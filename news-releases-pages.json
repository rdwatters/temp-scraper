They already knew the target group &#x2013; the students. They go to classes with them,&#x201D; Janakiraman said. &#x201C;The ultimate question was how does the church become appealing to the possible new members without alienating existing members.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Janakiraman said three teams in the undergraduate class and three teams in the graduate class started by talking extensively to five to 10 people at St. Alban&#x2019;s in the qualitative phase of the survey using a technique called laddering, that does a deep dive into consumer drives and motives. He said the student teams then presented a mid-term report to determine how prevalent the issues brought up by the smaller group were.</p>\n<p>The studies then expanded to more than 200 people in the second half of the semester in an attitude study that included a concept test and a brand positioning assessment test, which is the quantitative phase of the studies.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It really digs down and surveys many, many more people,&#x201D; Janakiraman said. &#x201C;What comes from both the qualitative and quantitative studies is a brand strategy for the church.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Janakiraman said if there was one prevalent strategy theme that emerged among the UTA teams studying St. Alban&#x2019;s, it was that more and deeper community outreach was needed. He also cited other options for the church to grow, including becoming more visible and more available to the UTA community.</p>\n<p>And according to many of St. Alban&#x2019;s members, the exercise was fruitful, and confirmed a few of the issues they knew and others that were new and insightful.</p>\n<p>Noni Ahlfinger, St. Alban&#x2019;s communications chair, said the UTA marketing class study of the church will drive future marketing plans.</p>\n<p>Steve Altman, who is on the St. Alban&#x2019;s newcomers committee, said, &#x201C;We understand this is a first and view this study of millennials by millennials to be expert data in our quest to interest more of this age group in our services. St. Alban&#x2019;s and UTA share a property line yet only a few students are aware of the church.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Ahlfinger said that church membership and leadership expect to shape how St. Alban&#x2019;s reached out to millennials.</p>\n<p>Laine Perry, St. Alban&#x2019;s infrastructure committee chair, said, &#x201C;It will help St. Alban&#x2019;s understand what millennials think of us and how we can be more visible to them. The semester experience of being probed by students has been warm and positive, even professional with students handling some difficult subjects respectfully. Clearly the study has fostered a measure of pride in our neighbors. Already discussions are brewing of additional UTA-St. Alban&#x2019;s cooperative programs.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Janakiraman said the exercise is a wonderful endeavor for classes in that it gives students something tangible to take to future employers.</p>\n<p>In the past, Janakiraman&#x2019;s classes have worked on marketing plans for a software company, a food company and an after-school program. Next semester, his classes will take on another neighbor, Bombay Chopstix, a restaurant in the College Park District.</p>\n<p>Chandra Subramaniam, interim dean of the College of Business, said Janakiraman&#x2019;s classes are providing intricate, valuable and practical marketing knowledge that his students can use in the real business world.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In Janakiraman&#x2019;s classes&#x2019; case, it helps our neighboring entities, which helps the UTA community,&#x201D; Subramaniam said. &#x201C;It speaks to building <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/communities.php\">sustainable urban communities</a>, one of the tenets of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Local businesses interested in examining their product and/or brand strategy would benefit from having Professor Janakiraman&#x2019;s classes address them as projects in their class.

A patient simply exhales into the device, which uses semiconductor sensors like those in a household carbon monoxide detector. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>The difference is that these sensors are specific to the gas detected, yet still inexpensive, and can isolate biomarkers associated with the flu virus and indicate whether or not the patient has the flu. The device could eventually be available in drugstores so that people can be diagnosed earlier and take advantage of medicine used to treat the flu in its earliest stages. This device may help prevent flu epidemics from spreading, protecting both individuals as well as the public health.</p>\n<p>Gouma and her team relied on existing medical literature to determine the quantities of known biomarkers present in a person&#x2019;s breath when afflicted with a particular disease, then applied that knowledge to find a combination of sensors for those biomarkers that is accurate for detecting the flu. For instance, people who suffer from asthma have increased nitric oxide concentration in their breath, and acetone is a known biomarker for diabetes and metabolic processes. When combined with a nitric oxide and an ammonia sensor, Gouma found that the breath monitor may detect the flu virus, possibly as well as tests done in a doctor&#x2019;s office.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption200\"><img alt=\"Sensors\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/breath-monitor-prototype-2.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Gouma&apos;s sensors are at the heart of her breath analyzer device.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;I think that technology like this is going to revolutionize personalized diagnostics. This will allow people to be proactive and catch illnesses early, and the technology can easily be used to detect other diseases, such as Ebola virus disease, simply by changing the sensors,&#x201D; said Gouma, who also is the lead scientist in the Institute for Predictive Performance Measurement at the UTA Research Institute.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Before we applied nanotechnology to create this device, the only way to detect biomarkers in a person&#x2019;s breath was through very expensive, highly-technical equipment in a lab, operated by skilled personnel. Now, this technology could be used by ordinary people to quickly and accurately diagnose illness.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Stathis Meletis, chair of the Materials Science and Engineering Department, noted that Gouma&#x2019;s research shows how UTA&#x2019;s nanotechnology research can have a profound impact on health and the human condition in our communities, as outlined in the University&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Gouma&#x2019;s development of a portable, single-exhale device that can be used to detect diseases has implications far beyond the laboratory,&#x201D; Meletis said. &#x201C;This shows the impact of nanotechnology on our everyday lives, and has potential for applications related to security and other important areas as well.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In addition to Gouma&#x2019;s research, UTA engineering faculty have applied nanotechnology to fighting cancer, increasing energy efficiency and detecting harmful substances, among other applications.</p>\n<p>Gouma joined UTA in 2016 after spending 16 years at SUNY Stony Brook. She earned more than $6 million in research funding from federal and state agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Defense. She is a member of the National Academy of Inventors, was a Fulbright Scholar and earned the prestigious Richard M.

Students cited several reasons for not completing the online course, which had a drop rate of 5 percent. While this rate is extremely low for open online courses, it still concerns corporate partners who have made a significant investment in employee development. The reasons given for discontinuing courses ranged from dissatisfaction due to technical issues to inability to keep up with course load.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our online course data already suggests students perform better when they have help and the social connection to support their learning,&#x201D; Siemens said. &#x201C;This connection contributes to their willingness to persevere through the course and could come in the form of interaction on the social network platform, experience in leveraging online social capital, and personal motivation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Understanding these social factors will uncover pedagogical and technological constraints that have negative impacts to student persistence,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>LINK is a research lab where researchers, educators, and graduate students connect, share, and collaborate in advancing social and technological networks, designing future learning models and exploring the future of higher education.</p>\n<p>LINK Research Lab was launched in 2013.

        "body": "\n<p>A new, comprehensive metastudy of the role technology plays in higher education urges universities of tomorrow to capitalize on technologies that effectively support student learning, to embrace blended learning environments, and to customize degree programs to serve the needs of students in a digital age.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption350\"><img alt src=\"/news/images/george-siemens.jpeg\" width=\"350\"><figcaption>George Siemens</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>George Siemens, executive director of The University of Texas at Arlington&#x2019;s Learning Innovation and Networked Knowledge Lab, is the lead author of &#x201C;Preparing for the Digital University: A Review of the History and Current State of Distance, Blended, and Online Learning.&#x201D; The international study offers strategies and important implications for higher education institutions preparing for the digital wave. It also emphasizes the importance of universities drawing from learning sciences research in preparing new models of teaching, learning, and student assessment.</p>\n<p>The paper is published on the LINK Research Lab&#xA0;<a href=\"http://linkresearchlab.org/PreparingDigitalUniversity.pdf\">website</a>&#xA0;and is part of the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.moocresearch.com/\">MOOC Research Initiative</a>, a project focused on Massive Open Online Courses that was funded by a $835,000 grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and administered by Athabasca University in Alberta, Canada.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The study supports previously published research that has found online learning to be equally or more effective than in-person instruction. The new study, however, delves further by examining the evolution of learning in digital spaces, including various approaches to credentialing and assessment beyond the traditional grading scale and diploma. Future technology structures that bear no resemblance to current learning management systems are described as part of the tool set for the 21st century education.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Over the next decade, even the most conservative systems will begin to adopt a greater range of digital technologies to support student learning and university operation in general,&#x201D; said Siemens, an internationally known expert and theorist in the field of digital learning who joined The University of Texas at Arlington last year. &#x201C;To prepare for this transition, we need to first understand the research of learning in online/blended/distance spaces.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He added: &#x201C;This is essentially about building a foundation so that we can get past the <i>&#x2018;but does online learning work&#x2019;</i> argument that often arises in the conversations. It works. Now, institutions must begin preparing their system for the digital movement.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>For their research, Siemens and his team members analyzed 339 secondary studies in the domains of distance education, online learning, and blended learning &#x2013; a practice that combines traditional face-to-face instruction with online learning &#x2013; using content analysis and citation network analysis research methods.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The move to digital education mirrors what has happened in much of society, where control shifts to the end user and reflects their needs and interests, not only those of the institution providing a service,&#x201D; Siemens said. &#x201C;To meet this challenge directly, universities need to start evaluating and changing existing policies, strategies and practices to benefit from digital learning.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Beyond showing no significant difference in effectiveness of online and face-to-face learning settings, the study provided directions for further research, necessary to better understand what practices work best in online settings. The transition to digital learning offers universities opportunities to reach more students and increase the quality of learning, while providing a range of options to students, the authors said.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Pete Smith, UT Arlington vice provost for digital teaching and learning, said the study will quickly become one of the &#x2018;standards&#x2019; in the scholarly literature.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It will be widely referenced and will inform research and other researchers for years to come,&#x201D; Smith said.</p>\n<p>Siemens is an early originator of open online education who taught one of the first open online courses in 2008 while a professor at University of Manitoba.</p>\n<p>Co-principal investigators on the new study are Dragan Ga&#x161;evi&#x107;, professor and chair in Learning Analytics and Informatics Schools of Education and Informatics at the University of Edinburgh; and Shane Dawson, acting director of the Learning and Teaching Unit at the University of South Australia.</p>\n<p>Ga&#x161;evi&#x107; said many universities are realizing the importance of digital education as a means to enhancing institutional learning and teaching strategies to increase accessibility and flexibility of courses and degree programs through online offerings.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;While there has been a vested amount of research available about the most effective learning and teaching approaches, there have not been reports that systematize that work in a single document,&#x201D; Ga&#x161;evi&#x107; said. &#x201C;This study specifically aimed to fill this gap and offers practical sources of information for policy makers, university leaders, academics and researchers.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Dawson said university leaders and educators are increasingly challenged with implementing new technologies to better supplement teaching and learning in order to meet the demands of the contemporary student cohort.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This study provides critical insights into the types of practices and approaches that have a reported demonstrated impact on the quality of student learning,&#x201D; Dawson said.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>In addition to Siemens, Ga&#x161;evi&#x107; and Dawson, co-authors on the report are Oleksandra Skrypnyk of the University of South Australia, Sre&#x107;ko Joksimovi&#x107; and Vitomir Kovanovi&#x107; of the University of Edinburgh, and Charles Lang of Harvard University.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About the UT Arlington LINK Research Lab</span></b></p>\n<p>The Learning Innovation and Networked Knowledge, or LINK, Research Lab at UT Arlington serves as the hub of a network of international scholars who conduct research on the digitization of knowledge and learning and how this process impacts education.

This was a seminal moment in time for the United States.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In early 2017, Lauster received a grant from the College of Liberal Arts&#x2019; Wright Faculty Research Endowment. It allowed him to purchase material and begin the complex process of bringing his idea to realization. By the end of the 2017, he had created an impressive 8-foot by 7-foot steel scale replica of Friendship 7, the spacecraft in which Glenn orbited the earth.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I wanted to create it in steel because Glenn flew for the Army, Navy and Marines, so I not only wanted to try to replicate the shuttle, but honor his history of flight with military,&#x201D; Lauster said. &#x201C;While I was working on it, I had the idea to create a solar component, which powers a series of interior sparkling lights. I created a small viewfinder where you can look inside the ship and see the lights which reference stars and celestial lights. Even though the sculpture is on the ground, you can see space.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/lauster-with-sculpture.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Associate Professor of Sculpture Darryl Lauster</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Lauster is one of the approximately 60 artists who make up the distinguished faculty of UTA&#x2019;s Art and Art History Department, which offers the second largest undergraduate art program in Texas.

He is artist who uses his studio not only to inspire a new generation of artists, but also to continually hone his craft,&#x201D; College of Liberal Arts Dean Elisabeth Cawthon said. &#x201C;What a thrill that the College was able to support this project.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Lauster said while the piece was interesting to make, it was extremely complex because he wanted the public to immediately recognize the sculpture as the Friendship 7 spacecraft. He wanted it to look iconic and he quickly realized he achieved that when he was driving the sculpture from one location to another.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I purchased the materials and began to work on it when I was in New York during the summer. When I drove it back to Arlington so that I could continue working on it, I had people waving at me and honking at me and pointing to the back of my truck asking, &#x2018;Hey is that a shuttle?&#x2019; People recognized it even before it was complete,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>He finished the sculpture in his studio on the UTA campus, side by side with his students so they could see how a project of such scale comes together.</p>\n<p>Lauster said it is an honor to be chosen for the Ocala Outdoor Sculpture Competition, one of the most well-known sculpture competitions in the nation. The piece will be on display in Ocala for the next 20 months.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s special for this piece to be in Florida, where the Friendship 7 originally launched,&#x201D; Lauster said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m so appreciative for the generous stipend I received from Dean Cawthon and it&#x2019;s quite gratifying to see this come full circle and represent UTA at a prestigious outdoor exhibition.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

        "body": "\n<p>Luke Frishkoff, University of Texas at Arlington assistant professor of biology, explores how human land use expedites biodiversity loss in a paper recently published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/natecolevol/\">Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/frishkoff---lizard-gray-branch.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>&#xFEFF;Anolis&#xFEFF; lizard</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>For a study conducted at the University of Toronto, Frishkoff, as a postdoctoral fellow, and his collaborators traveled to the Dominican Republic to take a census of the region&#x2019;s <i>Anolis</i> lizard species along an elevation gradient affected by deforestation. The species is a common group of tropical lizards that are a model system in ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This work uses elevation as a lens to understand the potential implications of climate change,&#x201D; Frishkoff said. &#x201C;Temperature changes along an elevation gradient, and general climate temperatures are expected to continue warming. By comparing the highlands to the lowlands, we can, in some sense, get a picture of how these biological communities might look in the future.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The lowlands along the gradient are warmer than the highlands due to altitude, and a forest canopy blocks direct sunlight making the vegetation-dense areas cooler than their agricultural surroundings at any elevation. The study determined elevation plays a major role in which species survive as humans modify the habitat.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The takeaway message is that the lizard communities in the lowlands are pretty good at coping with habitat conversion&#x2014;they lose abundance, but don&#x2019;t go extinct,&#x201D; Frishkoff said. &#x201C;When the forest is cut down in the highlands and the habitat warms, the pastures become filled with species from the warmer lowlands. Unlike the lowland species, the locally adapted forest lizards unique to the region&#x2019;s mountaintops cannot survive when the forest is cut down.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Frishkoff points out that biodiverse animals in any habitat act as &#x201C;ecological players&#x201D; to balance the ecosystem and often provide services that benefit humans in a variety of different ways. In order to get the most benefit from these ecological players, humans need to understand and have mechanisms to predict which species will survive as the climate warms and human land use changes, and Frishkoff&#x2019;s research indicates the effects of habitat conversion can change radically with elevation.</p>\n<p>The Dominican Republic study is part of a larger project, Frishkoff said. Since coming to UTA in September 2018, he has begun looking at lizard populations throughout Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Central America and Texas to understand the rules that govern species survival in a variety of different climates and conditions.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We need to be able to predict what species are going to do well in what environmental contexts,&#x201D; Frishkoff said. &#x201C;The broader goal is to lay that foundation to predict biological communities across climates, across land uses. So that eventually policymakers can use that information eventually to make decisions that integrate human wellbeing and biological wellbeing.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In his research, Frishkoff focuses mainly on reptiles and amphibians. He said the placement of UTA offers a great wealth of biological diversity to support his research, which is enriched by the university&#x2019;s Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center. The ARDRC is home to the largest herpetology collection in Texas with more than 200,000 specimens.</p>\n<p>Using the collection, Frishkoff&#x2019;s lab is beginning to study morphological differences between species to understand whether certain body shapes allow various species to do better in urban environments like the one UTA lies at the center of.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Luke&#x2019;s ongoing and developing research endeavors to address critical issues facing our global environment and support a sustainable urban community &#x2013; two driving themes of our university&#x2019;s strategic plan,&#x201D; said Clay Clark, professor and chair of the Department of Biology. &#x201C;He will make great contributions to our growing footprint as a research enterprise.&#x201D;</p>\n"

Fordjour is one of just 60 undergraduate scholars\nfrom across the United States selected from a field of 600 applicants. In\nApril, the winners will present their research to members of Congress,\nCongressional staffers and staff from government agencies.\n</p>\n<p>Fordjour, a double major in\nbiology and microbiology who plans to graduate in 2015, said the achievement\nrepresents another of the &#x201C;mind-blowing&#x201D; opportunities he has had since\nchoosing to attend UT Arlington.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My entire undergraduate career\nchanged after I got into research,&#x201D; said Fordjour, who moved to Irving from the\nUnited Kingdom after high school. &#x201C;So many doors have opened up to me, chances\nthat I never thought I would get.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Hurdle said the prestigious\naward reflects the dedicated work of Fordjour and his research partner Kieu\nDoan, another undergraduate in the chemistry/biochemistry department. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Emmanuel is a very promising\nscientific talent, exemplifying the high quality of students in the College of\nScience and undergraduate research participation in the Department of Biology,&#x201D;\nHurdle said. &#x201C;This honor will provide him the opportunity to shine light on a\ndisease that is hard to treat, frustrating to clinicians, causes much death and\nis now deemed an urgent public health threat by CDC. &#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Clostridium difficile<i>,</i> an intestinal bacterium also known as\nC. difficile, causes severe diarrhea and is responsible for at least 250,000\nhospitalizations and 14,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. Elderly and\nhospitalized patients are especially susceptible. Last year, the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention named C. difficile one of the three most &#x201C;urgent\ndrug resistant health threats.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>Fordjour saw firsthand the toll\nthat C. difficile could take while volunteering at Baylor Medical Center at\nIrving. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;C. difficile just stood out to\nme because it&#x2019;s a formidable pathogen. You get sick and you think you&#x2019;re done\nwith it, and it comes back,&#x201D; said Fordjour, who has volunteered 600 hours in\nthe hospital&#x2019;s emergency room. </p>\n<p>In a project overseen by Hurdle,\nFordjour and Doan tested combinations of current and in development antibiotics\nagainst clinically relevant C. difficile strains isolated from patients. He\nfound evidence that combining a currently used antibiotic called rifaximin and an\nantibiotic called fusidic acid that is still in clinical trials in the U.S. was\nparticularly effective against different strains of C. difficile in lab tests,\ngaining better results than either drug alone more than half the time.</p>\n<p>This combination could also\nreduce the risk of C. difficile developing resistance to either drug during\ntherapy, he said. The next step will be submitting those results for\npublication.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Rifaximin which is used to\ntreat traveler&#x2019;s diarrhea is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for\npatients who experience multiple episodes of treatment failures for CDI.&#xA0; The problem is that resistance can arise to\nrifaximin during treatment.&#xA0; We hope the\ncombinations showing improve efficacy over rifaximin alone, could provide a\nbetter treatment outcome,&#x201D; Hurdle said. </p>\n<p>In addition to Fordjour&#x2019;s work\nwith Hurdle, he is a member of the UT Arlington Honors College and a recipient\nof the UT System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, or LSAMP,\ngrant and a scholar in the Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement\nProgram. After graduation, he hopes to complete a combined M.D./Ph.D. program and become a\nphysician, educator and researcher. </p>\n<p>Ashley Purgason, assistant dean\nfor undergraduate research and student advancement in the College of Science,\nsaid Fordjour&#x2019;s success brings prestige to UT Arlington and its efforts to increase\nundergraduate research opportunities. Administrators hope to see more students\nseek out extracurricular experience in faculty laboratories.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We try to give our students\nthe best education we can in lecture halls and in our laboratory courses, but\nwhat really ignites a lifelong love of science is when our students can go\nfurther and get the thrill of inquiry-based experiments and the original\nthought that goes with that,&#x201D; Purgason said.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About UT Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution and\nthe second largest institution in The University of Texas System. <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> ranked\nUT Arlington as the seventh fastest-growing public research university in 2013.\n<i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> ranks UT Arlington fifth in the nation for\nundergraduate diversity.

        "body": "\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington College of Nursing and Health Innovation has been awarded a $1.8 million grant from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to lead a multi-institution study of clinical experience requirements for nursing school graduates.</p>\n<p>The research will involve more than 1,700 students over 30 months. In the end, the results will lead to a better understanding of the amount and nature of clinical experiences, or &#x201C;clinical hours,&#x201D; needed for competency upon graduation. Partners in the program include Tarleton State University, El Centro College, Brookhaven College, the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council Foundation and six North Texas health care systems.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption200\"><img alt src=\"/news/images/ann-bavier.jpeg\" width=\"200\"><figcaption>Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Currently, there is no state requirement addressing clinical experience for nursing students.

The Smart Hospital contains functional hospital rooms equipped with high-tech patient simulators and medical equipment.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There has never been a comprehensive study such as this focused on the clinical experiences students need to develop clinical competencies jointly agreed upon by academics and employers,&#x201D; said Mancini. &#x201C;With this information, it will be possible to identify an optimal range of clinical hours resulting in more efficient and effective nursing education.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Daisha Cipher, a clinical associate professor at UT Arlington, is another principal investigator on the new research project. Judy LeFlore, associate dean for simulation and technology, will be the project manager on the study.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The Coordinating Board is pleased to award this nursing grant to UT Arlington based on the institution&#x2019;s overall goal to establish a model of clinical instruction that can be replicated or adapted by the majority of nursing programs in Texas,&#x201D; said THECB Deputy Commissioner and Chief Academic Officer David Gardner. &#x201C;Improving the quality of nursing education is an important component of Texas&#x2019; higher education strategic plan, <i>Closing the Gaps by 2015</i>.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Health systems involved in the grant program include: HCA North Texas Division; Baylor Scott &amp; White Health; JPS Health Network; Kindred Healthcare; Methodist Health System; and Texas Health Resources.</p>\n<p>Sally Williams, DFWHC Foundation Workforce Center Director, said the Foundation is pleased to work with UT Arlington and the other North Texas nursing schools and hospitals to address the clinical experiences critical to nursing education.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Hospital employers are interested in making the clinical portion of nursing education more efficient and effective when preparing nursing graduates to be &#x2018;practice ready.&#x2019; This collaboration will make a significant impact on the preparation of future graduates entering the North Texas healthcare workforce,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p>The project will begin by identifying specific skills, behaviors and knowledge, or &#x201C;competencies,&#x201D; students should be taught in several medical areas, such as pediatrics and adult care. Then, data will be collected on study and control groups of nursing students as they move through their clinical experiences, including an initial simulation experience.</p>\n<p>In all, the researchers expect to gather more than one million data points before making recommendations based on their findings.</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington has one of the nation&#x2019;s largest nursing colleges with more than 12,000 students worldwide.

These molecules are in increasingly high demand for use in a variety of applications, including pharmaceutical and other medical-related activities. They are also widely used in organic chemistry, particularly as protecting groups, reducing agents and synthetic intermediates.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The goal of our research is to develop novel compounds from readily accessible, simple chemical building blocks,&#x201D; said Junha Jeon, UTA assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry and leader of the project. &#x201C;The synthetic methods developed in this research will provide broadly applicable, time- and cost-saving, synthetic routes to provide rapid access to compounds for subsequent use in drug discovery and development, thus contributing to the promotion of human health.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The project, titled &#x201C;Catalytic Reductive C-H and C-C Silylation with Silyl Acetals,&#x201D; is funded by a three-year, $424,720 grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, one of the National Institutes of Health.</p>\n<p>Current methods to prepare these organosilanes utilize multi-step procedures which demand considerable time and effort. The project&#x2019;s goal is the design and application of single-pot, transition metal-catalyzed reductive C-H and C-C silylations for the synthesis of a new class of organosilanes.</p>\n<p>A single-pot, or one-pot, synthesis improves the efficiency of a chemical reaction by subjecting a compound to successive chemical reactions using a single reactor. This method is preferred by chemists because it avoids a lengthy separation process and purification of the intermediate chemical compounds which saves time and resources while increasing chemical yield.</p>\n<p>Jeon said the research will deliver several positive outcomes.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There are three main aims of the research,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;In the first two, we will develop a new, simple, catalytic strategy for breaking an ubiquitous yet inert carbon-hydrogen bond and installing a new highly useful silicon moiety. This will allow for the rapid preparation of bio-medically important drugs.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The third aim will provide a new tool to selectively break a strong carbon-carbon bond over adjacent, abundant carbon-hydrogen bonds and incorporate a silicon moiety. This method will be highly useful to prepare biologically active, secondary metabolites and pharmaceuticals.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The project has already yielded one paper, titled&#xA0;<a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b04018\">&#x201C;Catalytic Reductive ortho-C&#x2014;H Silylation of Phenols with Traceless, Versatile Acetal Directing Groups and Synthetic Applications of Dioxasilines&#x201D;</a>, which was published in the&#xA0;<i>Journal of the American Chemical Society</i>&#xA0;in June. Jeon co-authored the paper with Yuanda Hua, a UTA postdoctoral researcher; and two of the graduate students who work in his laboratory, Parham Asgari and Thirupataiah Avullala.</p>\n<p>Jeon explained that during the past three decades, significant advances have been made to the organic processes of selectively transforming ubiquitous yet inert carbon-hydrogen bonds to other useful chemical entities. One reliable strategy for selective carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage within an organic is the use of a transition metal catalyst and a directing group, Jeon said. However, such a directing group is often difficult to install and manipulate after processes are completed.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In this paper we describe how we first developed a general strategy for transition metal catalyst-assisted, site-selective carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage and insertion of a silicon moiety to phenols with a traceless directing group,&#x201D; Jeon said. &#x201C;We believe that our new carbon-hydrogen bond functionalization approach to exploit readily available phenols and silanes more efficiently and cleanly will ultimately allow the practical production of diverse, biomedically important phenol derivatives and silicon-based materials.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>A traceless directing group means that after a specific group directs, or guides, a catalyst to a specific position of a carbon-hydrogen bond within phenol, the group disappears without a trace. Phenols are a group of organic compounds whose aromatic ring is bonded to an alcohol group. Because phenol contains an alcohol group, it is able to form a very strong hydrogen bond with other molecules and often displays significant biological activities. Silanes are the basic building blocks of silicon chemistry and are versatile materials used in a wide range of applications.</p>\n<p>Fred MacDonnell, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, said that Jeon&#x2019;s research has the potential to provide major positive impact on health and the human condition, one of four main themes in UTA&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Jeon&#x2019;s work is really starting to get a lot of attention from the scientific community and speaks to his creativity in this very challenging research area,&#x201D; MacDonnell said.</p>\n<p>Jeon joined UTA in 2011. He earned a bachelor&#x2019;s of science degree in Chemistry in 2000 and a master&#x2019;s degree in Organic Chemistry in 2002, both from Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea. He then came to the United States and did doctoral work at the University of Minnesota, receiving his Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry in 2009.

Interpretation of these data is always difficult however, because these patients also tend to have other cardiovascular abnormalities, such as insulin resistance and hypertension. Our study attempts to address this previous limitation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nelson and his team will study the effects of excess fat in isolation of cardiovascular or metabolic risk factors. Their preliminary data shows that men may respond differently than pre-menopausal women, who appear to be protected despite similar levels of fat in the heart. Nelson and his team of researchers will spend the next five years studying 60 healthy subjects &#x2013; 15 men and 45 women - between the ages of 18 and 30 to better understand the links between different factors.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The incidence of heart disease in premenopausal women is much less than their age-matched male counterparts,&#x201D; Nelson said. &#x201C;After menopause, however, women quickly catch up to men, and in some cases, surpass them.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This major new grant in UTA&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation is one of many new awards in the area of heart health over the last year, and reflects on the success of the College&#x2019;s strategic hires in kinesiology, a department whose research expenditures have grown significantly during the last four years. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s kinesiology department specializes in examining health and disease across the lifespan, with specialized research clusters looking at cardiovascular health, bone and muscle health, fighting cancer, and motor control development in children,&#x201D; UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said. &#x201C;This new NIH grant builds on ongoing research within the department and across UTA under our strategic plan theme of health and the human condition and highlights the research leadership and expertise of our renowned faculty.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m pleased to see them serve as lead principal investigators on collaborative projects with researchers representing leading universities and major medical research centers from around the country.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nelson, principal investigator on this project, will work with a team of researchers that includes Mark Haykowsky, professor of nursing at UTA and the Moritz Chair of Geriatrics, and Daisha Cipher, associate professor of nursing. Other co-investigators include researchers from UT Southwestern, Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and the University of Colorado in Denver.</p>\n<p>Collaborative projects are a hallmark of health science research at UTA, with highly regarded faculty members from the College of Nursing and Health Innovation routinely partnering with talented colleagues from UTA&#x2019;s other schools and colleges, as well as outside institutions, to facilitate fundamental and high-impact clinical translational research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Health science research requires an interdisciplinary focus to take innovation to the next level, and we at the College of Nursing and Health Innovation are proud to be at the forefront as the University continues to excel in cutting-edge research,&#x201D; said Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation.</p>\n<p>Opportunities for interdisciplinary research will be further enhanced when the state-of-the-art Science &amp; Engineering Innovation &amp; Research, or SEIR, Building opens in July 2018. In addition to supporting impressive campus-wide enrollment growth, the 220,000-square-foot building will feature research neighborhoods in which scientists from various health science disciplines will work together in 12 collaborative laboratory spaces focusing on thematic areas like cardiovascular health, brain health, cancer and tissue engineering. SEIR also will provide new opportunities for the university&#x2019;s focus on the study of human genomics as it relates to improving health and finding solutions for disease.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the NIH also awarded Nelson a $441,000 grant to build new imaging technology to study blood vessel function in patients with heart failure. This technology could lead to quicker diagnosis and life-saving treatment. Nelson is collaborating with colleagues from UTA&#x2019;s Department of Biomedical Engineering on this grant. Since joining UTA two years ago, Nelson has helped bring in more than $4 million in grants.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Over the last four years, UTA has received $11.5 million from the NIH, which speaks to the university&#x2019;s growing reputation as a major health science research institution,&#x201D; said Duane Dimos, UTA vice president for research.</p>\n<p>Research funding in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation rose by 45 percent from 2016 to 2017, due in part to the recent addition of 10 leading health care scholars to the college&#x2019;s faculty.&#xA0;</p>\n"

Both types of patients have high mortality rates.</p>\n<p>Typically, measuring leg blood flow and oxygen extraction and consumption is a tedious process. It requires the insertion of a catheter into an artery and vein.</p>\n<p>The team developed a technique to measure leg blood flow and oxygen consumption using magnetic resonance imagining technology. Following four minutes of constant knee extension exercise, the researchers measured leg oxygen consumption and its determinants during the recovery period.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We wanted to see if these two groups differ in their leg oxygen consumption in the recovery period after exercise, and if so, why this occurred,&#x201D; said Haykowsky.</p>\n<p>Their measurements showed that there was indeed a difference between the two groups.&#xA0; Leg blood flow and oxygen uptake recovery took longer in patients with dilated hearts.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This study is an important breakthrough because we were able to distinguish between different groups of heart failure patients,&#x201D; said Haykowsky. &#x201C;This could have important implications for exercise rehabilitation for heart failure patients. If we&#x2019;re able to differentiate between these heart failure groups then in the future we could target therapies aimed at increasing blood flow to their muscles and improve their exercise capacity.

Dombroski is well known in the Dallas business community as senior vice president at one of the largest privately held companies in the nation.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Harry Dombroski\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/dombroski-dean-cob.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Harry Dombroski, a longtime executive with Hunt Oil and Hunt Consolidated, has been named the dean of The University of Texas at Arlington College of Business.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;As an &#x2018;out-of-the-box&#x2019; thinker and results-oriented leader, Harry&#x2019;s contributions over his 30 plus year career with Hunt were essential to the growth and development of the Hunt family of companies,&#x201D; said Ray Hunt, executive chairman of Hunt Consolidated, Inc. &#x201C;Harry&#x2019;s contributions were not just limited to critical financial processes but included virtually every aspect of the company&#x2019;s activities, including leading several significant and innovative financing and business development activities.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I believe that Harry has the skill set to become an absolutely outstanding dean of the UTA College of Business. Further, as a graduate of UTA, he has the ability to differentiate himself and UTA in the very competitive marketplace of higher education in North Texas.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>For over 30 years, Dombroski has overseen the development and implementation of critical financial processes at Hunt Consolidated, Inc. In addition to managing Hunt&#x2019;s capital and investment decisions, Dombroski led several financing and business development initiatives, including the acquisition of Pacific Enterprise Oil Company, the approximately $1 billion expansion of the Company&#x2019;s Tuscaloosa refinery and placement of $100 million corporate (HCI) revolver facility.</p>\n<p>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said the addition of Dombroski will give the College of Business a needed touchstone to the business community.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The search committee brought a tremendous slate of highly distinguished and accomplished candidates to campus and I&#x2019;m thrilled that we were able to recruit Harry Dombroski to be the next dean of the College of Business,&#x201D; UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said. &#x201C;Harry is a visionary leader who will raise the visibility of the college, enhance its stature through transformative advances and propel the College of Business into a position of international competitiveness while ensuring that it becomes the &#x2018;go to&#x2019; place for business acumen globally.&#xA0; We are located in one of the largest and fastest growing economies in the nation and our College of Business needs to be right at the center of this growth.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>A UTA alumnus, Dombroski will be returning to his roots and bringing his unparalleled business acumen and expertise to the College of Business.</p>\n<p>Dale Petroskey, president and CEO of the Dallas Regional Chamber, said, &#x201C;The University of Texas at Arlington has been producing talented and hard-working graduates for a long time, and now they&#x2019;re entering an exciting new chapter with the selection of Mr. Dombroski as the new dean of the College of Business. The Dombroski era will be exciting for two reasons &#x2013; it shows UTA&#x2019;s commitment to modernizing how students are taught, and his extensive experience in the corporate sector will give students a real-world view of the business world and help them get off to a fast start in whatever field they choose.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dombroski is eager to begin his new position at the College of Business. With his extensive ties to corporations in the area, he looks forward to expanding UTA&#x2019;s relationships with community partners. His multipronged approach to positioning the University as a nucleus of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex will benefit UTA students with increased opportunities for internships and career entry and will further leverage the scholarship and expertise of its faculty to being the thought leaders for the region and nation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is always an intrinsic blessing to come full circle in one&#x2019;s career. When I graduated from UTA in 1979, I was prepped and ready to enter the workforce,&#x201D; Dombroski said. &#x201C;The education that I received at UTA was the spark that fueled a long, rewarding career. I look forward to being able to pay that back to current UTA students and future graduates.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s commitment to greater engagement with the corporate world, focus on being the very best through transformative changes and modernizing offerings based on the needs of the workforce was a key reason for his appointment.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Harry doesn&#x2019;t come from the traditional academic side of the house. However, he has been very engaged with our faculty and students over many years,&#x201D; said Teik C. Lim, UTA provost and vice president for academic affairs. &#x201C;Harry knows the desires of employers and how to match the rapid change of the industry. Bringing in a person with that firsthand knowledge will better position UTA amongst business leaders and help to serve our students with better opportunities after they graduate.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>His first day as dean will be Monday, April 30.</p>\n"

Parr is the holder of the UNESCO Chair on Water Access and Sustainability at the University of Cincinnati, where she is a Professor in the Department of Political Science in the College of Arts and Science with a joint appointment in the School of Architecture and Interior Design. She is currently the director of the Taft Research Center for Humanities at the University of Cincinnati and a Distinguished Fellow of the Global Center for Advanced Studies.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Adrian Parr\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/adrian-parr-cappa-dean.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Adrian Parr was named dean of the UTA College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Her husband, Michael Zaretsky, award-winning architect and director of the MetroLAB design/build initiative at the University of Cincinnati, and associate dean of faculty affairs and curriculum in the Cincinnati College of Design, Architecture, Art and Planning will join UTA&#x2019;s Department of Civil Engineering in the College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The simultaneous addition of Parr and Zaretsky to our faculty, with their tremendous experience and expertise in the design and development of sustainable urban communities, will have a long-lasting impact on our ability to produce the next generation urbanists, architects, engineers and scientists,&#x201D; UTA Provost Teik C. Lim said.</p>\n<p>Parr&#x2019;s international network, through her UNESCO chair, will allow UTA to establish partnerships and grow programs through USAID and other sources, especially in the area of water resource management, that is already a strength for UTA. Zaretsky&#x2019;s experience leading and coordinating the MetroLAB design/build initiative in Cincinnati will help the University better engage local cities, non-profit organizations and companies involved in infrastructure projects and development of the built environment.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Adrian Parr and her husband Michael Zaretsky are highly-regarded leaders in the field who have pushed the boundaries of what it means to be an architect or urbanist,&#x201D; said architect and UTA alumnus Randy Gideon, who was involved in the search process for a new CAPPA dean. &#x201C;The DFW region will be enriched by their vision and experience developing smart, sustainable megacities, as well as their global networks through leadership roles in international organizations like UNESCO.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Currently, half of the world&#x2019;s population lives in megacities and urban environments. The growing metroplex of Fort Worth-Arlington-Dallas is expected to reach megacity status with a population of more than 10 million in the next decade. Because of that burgeoning population growth, one of today&#x2019;s most formidable challenges is planning for urban growth and the manner in which it amplifies or, preferably, diminishes, social inequities and environmental degradation. Parr says CAPPA is well-positioned to help communities address these challenges.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Michael Zaretsky\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/michael-zaretsky.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Michael Zaretsky will&#xA0;join UTA&#x2019;s Department of Civil Engineering in the College of Engineering.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;New forms of urbanization and organization demand scholars and practitioners imaginatively experiment with inherited forms of knowledge and practice, all the while pushing the boundaries of making, building and planning the policies driving urban change,&#x201D; Parr said. &#x201C;CAPPA combines architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, urban planning and public affairs to respond to these issues. I am excited to expand the impact of CAPPA across the university, DFW, nationally and internationally.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In conjunction with his faculty position, Zaretsky will provide leadership in establishing and building an internationally recognized new center at UTA focused on smart, sustainable megacities. This new research center will bring together research and teaching conducted by CAPPA, departments within the College of Engineering and other related fields of discipline at UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My experience in human-centered design, design/build and public-interest design fit well with the University&#x2019;s strategic themes of <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/communities.php\">sustainable urban communities</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/impact.php\">global environmental impact</a>,&#x201D; Zaretsky said. &#x201C;I plan to work across the colleges as well as across UTA and the DFW communities to collaboratively focus on these critical initiatives.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In partnership, these two leaders will help us build programs in new areas and areas where the University has existing expertise: infrastructure reliability, water management, city planning, built environment and architectural engineering,&#x201D; Lim said.</p>\n<p>A cross-disciplinary scholar, Parr also recently produced and directed the award-winning documentary &#x201C;The Intimate Realities of Water,&#x201D; which examines the power dynamics of water and slums. The film chronicles the complex relationships between water, poverty, gender, sanitation, health and development in Nairobi&#x2019;s shantytowns. It won Best Documentary at the United International Independent Film Festival and Best First Time Filmmaker at the Hollywood International Independent Documentary awards, among other honors.</p>\n<p>She earned her undergraduate and graduate degrees from Deakin University in Australia: a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in philosophy, an honors degree in Philosophy and a master&#x2019;s degree in politics and philosophy. Her doctorate is in philosophy and cultural studies from Monash University in Australia. She was an adjunct professor at both institutions. Parr also served as assistant professor in Art History at Savannah College of Art and Design before joining the University of Cincinnati.</p>\n<p>Zaretsky earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in art history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and a Master of Architecture degree from the University of Oregon in Eugene. He has been a licensed architect in California since 2003.</p>\n"

UTA is the largest public four-year university in Texas designated as an HSI and one of only 10 universities in the nation to achieve the designation of both HSI and R-1: Highest Research Activity in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.</p>\n<p>The HSI designation allowed UTA to become eligible for additional federal funding for initiatives aimed at expanding educational opportunities and increasing degree attainment rates among all students. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Education awarded UTA a highly competitive, five-year $2.62 million grant to enhance services and increase graduation and retention rates among lower-income and Hispanic students. Martinez-Cosio is the co-lead principal investigator on the grant with Carla Amaro-Jimenez, associate professor in UTA&#x2019;s College of Education and Jennifer Luken, director of UTA&#x2019;s TRiO-Student Support Services. The grant funds the UTA IDEAS Center &#x2013; for Innovation, Diversity, Excellence, Access and Success.</p>\n<p>The IDEAS Center is located in UTA&#x2019;s Central Library and offers access to support services for students in transition, particularly transfer students, veterans and those from underserved populations. The grant also provides funding for professional development of faculty members, exposing them to innovative methods of teaching to help them build connections with first-generation students.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;On days when I need a little mood boost, I stop in the IDEAS Center. I see students working with mentors and tutors, students brainstorming on white boards purchased with grant money and collaborating in groups using new spaces that we designed. It truly reaffirms why we do what we do at UTA,&#x201D; Martinez-Cosio said.</p>\n<p>Martinez-Cosio was born in Mexico and immigrated to San Diego with her parents when she was 10 years old. She loved to read and learn but had to work hard to overcome a language barrier. No one in her family had attended college, so Martinez-Cosio didn&#x2019;t plan to either, until a high school counselor suggested it. He helped her fill out an application to the University of California, San Diego, and she was accepted.</p>\n<p>To pay for tuition, Martinez-Cosio drove a school bus for disabled students in a nearby school district each morning and afternoon, and she squeezed in classes in between bus routes. Eventually, she earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree, a master&#x2019;s degree and a doctorate in sociology. Along the way she discovered her passion for community service and removing barriers to higher education. She says she is humbled by the award.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;One of UTA&#x2019;s greatest strengths is our diversity among both students and faculty. We want to continue to build upon this by attracting even more Latino and African American faculty members,&#x201D; Martinez-Cosio said. &#x201C;I sincerely thank Ford Motor Company for honoring the work we are doing, because I believe this will show students the impact you can make by going beyond a bachelor&#x2019;s degree. We want to encourage students from all backgrounds to earn a master&#x2019;s and a Ph.D. and return to campus and teach.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Martinez-Cosio&#x2019;s work exemplifies progress along UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>. Transforming the student experience by enhancing access and ensuring success is one of the plan&#x2019;s guiding aspirations.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s vitally important for our state to add more degree-holding citizens from all walks of life because that infuses an immense amount of knowledge and creativity into the workforce,&#x201D; said state Rep. Roberto Alonzo, D-Dallas. &#x201C;I commend UTA for the work it has done over the past few years to increase access to higher education for all Texans.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The 2017 North Texas Mujeres Legendarias Awards also recognized commercial real estate agent Amanda Moreno-Lake, artist and teacher Viola Delgado and co-founder of Sierra Shred Lucretia Lucio. Previous recipients from UTA include Liliana Perez-Nordtvedt, associate professor of marketing, and Minerva Cordero-Epperson, professor of mathematics and associate dean for academic affairs in the College of Science.&#xA0;</p>\n"

I congratulate Ryan and I&#x2019;m excited that future students can continue to learn from his excellence.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Su plans to study for his MBA after he graduates.

He registered for the Capsim Challenge because &#x201C;I enjoy competing with students from other schools.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The biannual Capsim Challenge is open to all students who have completed a Capsim business simulation in the preceding semester and attracts thousands of competitors worldwide. The top six teams compete to see who can run the top corporation in a high pressure, zero sum environment. They are assessed using a Balanced Scorecard, ensuring the finalists succeed on a range of business parameters, not just the bottom line.</p>\n<p>According to Capsim President Reda Chafai, &#x201C;Descartes said understanding requires intuition and deduction, and a business simulation provides practice in both. It has the financial information students need to deduce what the competition is doing &#x2013; and how to respond &#x2013; and offers the experience they need to develop their business intuition. Ryan has demonstrated he has what it takes to make a great manager &#x2013; one who understands business from many different angles.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Luke Courtright, coordinator of the Capsim Challenge, said, &#x201C;There is an impressive level of professionalism and dedication in our finalists. They enter the competition on their own time, at a very busy time of year, and give it all they&#x2019;ve got. Winners like Ryan show they can work in a pressured environment, making decisions, analyzing data, and getting results fast. He&#x2019;s got a solid start for a successful career in business.&#x201D;</p>\n"

The scientific community has been studying oxygen delivery or oxygen utilization in isolation for some time, but no one has been able to simultaneously study both of these endpoints in the same patient, especially not non-invasively. This will be the first study to assess both sides of the equation at the same time in a clinical setting.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He said the technology will use laser light to track the movement of red blood cells in muscles as well as the oxygen content of the muscle itself. The team plans to develop both the hardware and software in the first year of the grant so that they can begin doing patient studies quickly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Once developed, the technology will be applicable to a wide range of diseases and health conditions. The researchers will focus on patients with heart failure in this project because, despite the name of the diagnosis, these patients also have severe limitations in their peripheral blood vessels and skeletal muscles.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If the muscles are not utilizing oxygen or getting enough oxygen it could contribute to exercise intolerance,&#x201D; Nelson said. &#x201C;By using this technology we will be able to pinpoint specific problems in the periphery and identify new therapeutic targets.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Anne Bavier, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation, said the outcome of this study could be transformative for cardiovascular care.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;For too long people have focused on the heart when it comes to these ailments. But Mike&#x2019;s research so far shows that some of the problems must lie in the muscles. This could strike a big blow for improving health care nationally and globally,&#x201D; said Bavier, who noted that improving health care and the human condition is one of the four themes of UTA&#x2019;s strategic plan. &#x201C;There are plenty of drugs to help treat patients with heart failure, but which one is the best option? I believe this technology has the potential to address this problem by giving clinicians the tools and insight to define therapeutic targets.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In recent years, the college has been steadily transforming into an important destination for health care research, attracting many leading health care scholars. With the influx of these scholars has come a significant increase in research grants. The college now has nearly $8 million in active research grants, up 45 percent from the previous year.</p>\n"

She earned a doctorate in history from Yale University, a master&#x2019;s degree in African American Studies from Yale, a master&#x2019;s degree in education from Harvard, and graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> and Phi Beta Kappa with bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in history and English from George Washington University.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Price is currently a visiting assistant professor at Hollins University in Roanoke, Va.</p>\n<p>While at Yale, Price was awarded two fellowships for graduate study from the Gilder Lehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition at the Whitney and Betty MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies, a Bloomfield Fellowship and a John F. Enders Fellowship and Research Grant.</p>\n<p>She has taught undergraduate classes in Public History, Black Women in the U.S., the American South, the Modern United States and African American History until 1863. Her graduate teaching has focused on slavery, abolition and modern African American history.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Gerald Jaynes, professor of economics and African American Studies at Yale, said, &#x201C;Black cooperative enterprises challenged state-sponsored discrimination, black economic deprivation, and in the larger realm of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, struggle for racial equality provided a framework for African American economic protest.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In her current book project, Price draws upon business records, statistics of sales, profit and loss, and historical documents such as sermons, speeches, papers of educators and articles in the African American press.</p>\n<p>Jaynes said, &#x201C;We still know relatively little about the group economic aspirations and ventures of the freed slaves and their immediate progeny during the period between the end of reconstruction and the beginning of the Great Migration about 1910. Dr. Price&#x2019;s work promises to illuminate that story.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Price joins an accomplished team of scholar-teachers in the Department of History. Leading experts in their respective fields, the department&#x2019;s interdisciplinary faculty have been recognized for their path-breaking scholarship through fellowships and grants from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, American Council of Learned Societies, British Library, National Endowment for the Humanities, and National Humanities Center, among many others. Their accomplishments extend into the classroom where they have likewise garnered recognition for innovative instructional methods that promote student engagement and success.</p>\n<p>History faculty are key contributors to the College of Liberal Arts&#x2019; mission, which focuses on elevating the human condition through research, scholarship and creative activity. The college boasts more than 300 faculty who are nationally and internationally recognized as experts in their fields and renowned for their award-winning research. These dedicated professionals serve a diverse population of more than 4,000 students in 12 departments and four centers; the college offers 47 majors in the humanities, social sciences and fine arts.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>With defining values of inclusiveness, diversity, community and collaboration, the College of Liberal Arts provides students with the ability to examine their place in the world. Faculty are expected to encourage the cultivation of partnerships and collaborative efforts to make an impact on a local and global society.</p>\n<p>Stephanie Cole, who chaired the national search committee, observes that, &#x201C;Dr. Price&#x2019;s research on African American cooperative business enterprises in the Jim Crow South demonstrates not only a keen awareness of the oppressive world in which African Americans functioned, but also how talented business leaders worked together to navigate difficult terrain successfully. Her command of 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> century national and regional economies as well as the literature on African American business history is impressive.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Cawthon, dean of the College of Liberal Arts, said, &#x201C;Dr. Price is an outstanding hire owing to her commitment to first-rate teaching as well as her exceptional research on black entrepreneurship. Her work dovetails with the focus of the College of Liberal Arts upon entrepreneurialism in the arts, humanities and social sciences. She is uniquely equipped to make a seamless entry into the College as we continue to support UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.&quot;</p>\n<p>Price officially joins the college as a faculty member at UTA in August 2018.

U.S. News &amp; World Report is a recognized leader in higher education rankings.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s School of Social Work is steadily gaining recognition as one of the best social work programs in the country,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;We have become a recognized destination university for social work students not only in North Texas or our state, but the nation and even the world.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>School of Social Work Dean Scott Ryan attributed part of the program&#x2019;s success on UTA&#x2019;s commitment to enabling students to gain real experience through research carried with faculty in the community, which results in a strong placement record for students immediately upon graduation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our students get the chance to not only learn from the great minds represented through our faculty but also participate in community projects that professors are undertaking. That research gives students an extra opportunity to impress future employers with their practical experience, which is vital in our field,&#x201D; Ryan said.</p>\n<p>UTA estimates that more than 90 percent of the 115 masters and doctoral students graduating this spring will have positions in the workforce upon leaving the University.</p>\n<p>Funding for School of Social Work research projects is also steadily increasing, with grants awarded growing from $1.9 million to $3.06 million between 2014 and 2017. Research expenditures, a measure of funds directly spent on projects, also increased from $2.3 million to $3.6 million over the last four years, a 36 percent increase.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This increased funding means we are also better prepared to carry out more projects with students, and also results in greater recognition for our faculty as a leading research institution,&#x201D; Ryan said. &#x201C;Having that validation from your peers is especially gratifying.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Another indicator of the success of UTA&#x2019;s numerous joint student-faculty collaborations was reflected in the large number of presentations made by the School at the 2018 Society for Social Work and Research Conference in Washington in January, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diane Mitschke, director of the graduate programs, and graduate student Nabiba Hasan, presented their work on religion as a source of strength for recently resettled refugees from Syria</li>\n<li>Social work doctoral student, Marcus Crawford, and assistant dean for research and faculty affairs, Holli Slater, gave a presentation on outcomes for youth aging out of foster care</li>\n<li>Cecilia Mengo and Youn Kyoung (Lily) Kim, who both graduated from the UTA doctoral program in social work in 2016 and are now teaching at other universities, gave a presentation on research they conducted with UTA social work associate professor, Eusebius Small, on peer affiliation, school bullying victimization and substance misuse among adolescents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>State Rep. Toni Rose, D-Dallas, added that the work of UTA&#x2019;s School of Social Work is reflected in the community it serves.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Some of the UTA projects help non-profits and charitable organizations that serve people in our communities who are hurt or need help,&#x201D; said Rep. Rose.</p>\n<p>U.S. News &amp; World Report considers factors such as evidence of excellence in faculty and students as well as reputation including surveys of peers in compiling its annual rankings.</p>\n<p>In addition to the School of Social Work in the U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings, the College of Engineering is now ranked in the Top 100 of all engineering schools being evaluated.</p>\n<p>Recently, UTA also placed No. 10 in the nation among online schools for education majors according to BestCollegeReviews.org. UTA was recognized for offering multiple start dates for students&#x2019; convenience, including a nine-month superintendent certificate available entirely online. OnlineDegrees.com also ranked UTA No. 6 in a new study of all Texas colleges offering online degrees, crediting the University for affordability, flexibility and student services.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Guests also include CHCI alumni and current program participants - the nation&apos;s next generation of Latino leaders.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This event demonstrates to our young people the promise of what a unified community with passionate, dedicated and prepared leaders can achieve - a stronger America for us all,&#x201D; Castro said.</p>\n<p>Bobadilla is no stranger to the nationwide or statewide scene.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Foundation named Bobadilla chair of its new University Partnerships initiative.</p>\n<p>The initiative&#x2019;s goal is to build a robust college-to-career pipeline between Hispanic-Serving Institutions, like UTA, and the corporations who partner with the Foundation, resulting in enhanced career readiness for students and an immediately employable talent pool for various industries.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA serves more Hispanic students than any other four-year public university in North Texas. UTA is one of only 10 universities in the nation to achieve the designation of both Hispanic-Serving Institution and R-1: Highest Research Activity in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.</p>\n<p>In 2015, UTA&#x2019;s University Crossroads program, which Bobadilla started, was recognized with the Miguel Hidalgo Award by the Oak Cliff Coalition for the Arts for its educational outreach and widespread impact on the Hispanic community in Dallas.</p>\n<p>In 2014, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities named UTA its Outstanding HACU-Member Institution for the school&#x2019;s contributions to Hispanic higher education.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Bobadilla was one of four women across the state to be honored with Outstanding Women in Texas Government awards.</p>\n"

Other researchers included Paul Fadel, a professor of kinesiology, the college&#x2019;s associate dean for research and director of the lab; David Keller, professor and chair of the Department of Kinesiology, and doctoral students Jordan Patik and Benjamin Young.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s common knowledge that black men are disproportionately at risk for high blood pressure,&#x201D; said Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation. &#x201C;A study of this kind that utilizes healthy, young males significantly broadens our understanding of how this disease affects this population as well as the long-term implications.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Vranish said future studies may help researchers understand why blacks are more prone to high blood pressure and subsequent cardiovascular diseases.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We know that blacks develop high blood pressure earlier in life and at greater severity than other races,&#x201D; Vranish said. &#x201C;What we don&#x2019;t know is why. We think this heightened blood pressure response to the sympathetic nervous system at rest might be one of several reasons they are more predisposed to cardiovascular risk later in life.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The researchers studied 35 young men of similar height, weight and body mass index who were non-smokers and had no history of neural, cardiovascular or respiratory disease. In all, 18 of the men were white and 17 were black.</p>\n<p>The findings of the study highlight a potential source of future cardiovascular risk in blacks and provide some insight into how this population may develop hypertension later in life.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not sure why these differences exist but some potential mechanisms include differences in vascular function and responsiveness,&#x201D; Vranish said.</p>\n<p>This new study is yet another example of the college&#x2019;s focus on improving health and the human condition through research. The college has an aggressive research agenda to find solutions to a variety of ailments, including hypertension, esophageal cancer, osteoporosis, several forms of heart disease and developmental coordination disorders.</p>\n<p>In the last three years, the college has added 10 renowned scholars to its faculty, a number that is expected to continue to rise. During that period, the college&#x2019;s faculty has attracted more than $7 million in grants from sources such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Faculty members routinely team up with colleagues in other schools and colleges, such as engineering and social work, on research projects.</p>\n"

One was a rockshelter at Pinnacle Point where people lived &#x2013; sleeping at night, cooking food and sharing stories around the campfire. The others were at an open-air site just nine kilometers away, a location where humans collected stone and processed it for future tool manufacture.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Finding the shards from Toba at these two sites means that we can link the sites at a temporal precision of about two weeks and say that the people at the sites were almost certainly of the same social group, and link activities at one site to the other,&#x201D; Cleghorn said. &#x201C;For archaeologists, that is an extraordinary result.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/2017-07-06-105615.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>A view of the Knysna archaeological project.

Once two sites were identified, the process is extending to other sites, including Knysna, Cleghorn&#x2019;s current dig.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s support was instrumental in getting Cleghorn&#x2019;s project started at Knysna. Cleghorn used a Research Enhancement Program grant to run the initial test excavation, which provided the evidence needed to attract external funding for the project over several years from the Leakey Foundation, National Science Foundation, Templeton Foundation and Hyde Family Foundation. The College of Liberal Arts also supported research into mineral pigment use at the Knysna site.</p>\n<p>So far, some dozen UTA students have participated in the Knysna field project, and this year Cleghorn is taking five current or former UTA students into the field with significant funding support.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Naomi Cleghorn&#x2019;s work is foundational to paleosciences and her significant funding also demonstrates the value that leading foundations give to her work,&#x201D; said Elizabeth Cawthon, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Liberal Arts. &#x201C;It is also cross-disciplinary work linking UTA&#x2019;s strategic themes of global environmental impact and sustainable urban communities.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Overuse of existing antibiotics has worsened the problem, resulting in an urgent need to develop new types of antimicrobial agents to combat the ever-increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are developing synthetic antimicrobial materials that only target toxic bacteria and are biocompatible with healthy mammalian cells,&#x201D; said He Dong, the UTA associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry and joint associate professor of bioengineering who received the grant. &#x201C;These new molecules show great promise to treat infections not only on external surfaces or the skin like traditional antimicrobial peptides do, but also internally through oral or intravenous treatments, as they do not attack healthy human cells.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The earlier discovery of new antimicrobials based on small proteins or peptides had shown tremendous promise, but their widespread use and translation into clinical application was hampered by their toxicity toward a range of healthy human cells.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dong and her colleagues have taken this idea one step further by developing synthetic peptides that self-assemble into nanostructured fibers that can punch holes in the bacterial membrane, killing the pathogen,&#x201D; said Frederick MacDonnell, the chair of UTA&#x2019;s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. &#x201C;These synthetic self-assembling antimicrobial nanofibers, or SAANs, are the nucleus of a new therapeutic platform that could have a transformative impact on the multi-billion-dollar research industry around conventional antibiotics.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>This new grant builds on work done over the last three years by Dong around nanomaterials that can mimic nature and self-assemble into larger groups of molecules that have antimicrobial effects without hurting other healthy cells. The $456,985 grant is aimed at furthering the understanding of how SAANs are so effective against bacteria without harming healthy mammalian cells.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The multidisciplinary nature of this research, involving chemistry, microbiology, engineering, nanoscience and pharmaceutical sciences will also provide opportunities to train students at all levels,&#x201D; Dong added. &#x201C;We plan to collaborate closely with Dr. Liping Tang in UTA&#x2019;s bioengineering department to develop intelligent SAANs technologies that will permit highly effective and accurate disease-specific diagnoses and therapies in the future.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dong will soon be transferring to UTA&#x2019;s new 229,000-square-foot Science &amp; Engineering Innovation &amp; Research or SEIR building, a world-class research and teaching facility focused on health science research that is scheduled to open in July 2018. This facility will advance research at UTA by utilizing the modern concept of research lab neighborhoods to drive cross-disciplinary collaboration like Dong&#x2019;s research. Each of the 12 research lab neighborhoods will accommodate multiple teams in a wide range of fields, including biology, bioengineering, computational research, nursing and kinesiology.</p>\n<p>Dong came to UTA from Clarkson University, where she was an assistant professor of chemistry and biomolecular science. She earned her bachelor and master degrees in chemistry from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, and her doctorate in chemistry from Rice University in Houston. She did her first post-doctoral fellowship in the Department of Surgery at Emory University in Atlanta, and her second in materials science and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Dong&#x2019;s research exemplifies UTA&#x2019;s interdisciplinary approach to research, especially in the area of health and the human condition, one of four themes of the University&#x2019;s strategic plan,&#x201D; added MacDonnell. &#x201C;This early CAREER grant recognizes the potential of her research focus to make a real impact on the field.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

But if matter and antimatter are produced equally, then all of the matter created in the early universe should have been cancelled out by equal amounts of antimatter, eliminating existence itself instantly. And we would not exist.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>To explain this asymmetry, some particle physicists claim that the tiny subatomic particle, the neutrino, and its antimatter particle, the antineutrino, are in fact the same particle. This might account for the overall excess of matter in the universe as a whole&#x2014; and why we are here.</p>\n<p>UTA researchers are now taking advantage of a biochemistry technique that uses fluorescence to detect ions to identify the product of a radioactive decay called neutrinoless double-beta decay that would demonstrate that the neutrino is its own antiparticle.</p>\n<p>Radioactive decay is the breakdown of an atomic nucleus releasing energy and matter from the nucleus. Ordinary double-beta decay is an unusual mode of radioactivity in which a nucleus emits two electrons and two antineutrinos at the same time. However, if neutrinos and antineutrinos are in fact identical, then the two antineutrinos can cancel each other, resulting in what is termed a neutrinoless decay, with all of the energy given to the two electrons.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>To find this neutrinoless double-beta decay, scientists are looking at a very rare event that occurs about once a year, when a xenon atom decays and converts to barium. If a neutrinoless double-beta decay has occurred, you would expect to find a barium ion in coincidence with two electrons of the right total energy. &#xA0;UTA researchers&#x2019; proposed new detector precisely would permit identifying this single barium ion accompanying pairs of electrons created within large quantities of xenon gas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If we observe even one such event, it would be a profound discovery in particle physics, on par with the discovery of the Higgs boson,&#x201D; said Ben Jones, UTA assistant professor of physics, who is leading this research for the American branch of the Neutrino Experiment with Xenon TPC - Time Projection Chamber or NEXT program, which&#xA0;searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay.&#xA0;Other UTA researchers also collaborated on the ATLAS experiment, which led to the Nobel Prize winning discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.</p>\n<p>The researchers, who published their discovery Monday in <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.132504\">Physical Review Letters</a>, have demonstrated the effectiveness of their technique on a small scale and now plan to use the device in a large-scale detector, which they envision as a chamber containing a ton of high-pressure, purified xenon gas.</p>\n<p>David Nygren, UTA Presidential Distinguished Professor of Physics and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, had the idea to look at fluorescence when he realized how neuroscientists use the technique to look at calcium ions that jump from neuron to neuron in the brain.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I realized that calcium and barium are not so different, so perhaps we could use the same technique to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay,&#x201D; Nygren said.</p>\n<p>Early research with UTA graduate student Austin McDonald identified a chemical compound called FLUO-3 that not only works with calcium ions but is also sensitive to barium. From there, the team devised a device that could reveal barium ions in a large volume of gaseous xenon, which was proven in the published paper.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The beauty of this research is that it brings together physicists and chemists to generate creative new solutions to enable discoveries in fundamental physics,&#x201D; said UTA physics chair Alex Weiss. &#x201C;This work also clearly demonstrates the ability of students and faculty at UTA to lead the way in international physics projects and represents an important example of the world-class research enabled by UTA&#x2019;s focus on data-driven discovery.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

We hope to sell these two units once they&#x2019;re completed and fund future projects for Parallel Construction.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Parallel Construction is the name of CAPPA&#x2019;s design/build program, now in its fourth semester, offering students the opportunity to literally get their hands dirty, as they design and build projects.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Tiny houses\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/cappa-tiny-house-3.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Two tiny houses are being constructed by CAPPA students.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>McCorkle said the tiny houses have received some interest from non-profit organizations and private individuals who have odd-sized residential lots where structures like these make sense.</p>\n<p>Tiny houses are the rage, due in some part to cable television shows that have promoted the trend. HGTV has Tiny House Builders, Tiny House Hunters and Tiny House, Big Living. FYI, the cable network, started Tiny House Nation and Tiny House World. Other networks have run several specials on the phenomena.</p>\n<p>What the students like about the project is that it translates to real-world experience.</p>\n<p>As seniors, architecture students have several options for their senior year: a traditional design studio, a research studio or the design/build studio.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We have to take this project and have a design, construction documents, a budget and then build it,&#x201D; said Omar Soto, a project manager on one of the tiny houses.</p>\n<p>Cosette Meyer, a co-project manager with Soto, said being involved through each phase of project from design to construction is vital experience for the professional world.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;There are real-world implications with each decision we make,&#x201D; Meyer said. &#x201C;Deciding on certain hardware has an impact on the bottom line. We need to take all of that into account.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Adam Fogel, the project manager for the other tiny house, said students learn on this job site what works and what doesn&#x2019;t.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption250\"><img alt=\"Brad McCorkle\" id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/cappa-tiny-house-2.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Brad McCorkle, CAPPA lecturer, is leading a group of students in their design/build project.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;In the lab, you can change things on the computer until it works,&#x201D; Fogel said. &#x201C;Out here, you should be fairly certain what will work before you start nailing or putting in insulation or something else that is permanent. You have to answer questions like: &#x2018;Where do you make sacrifices?&#x2019; &#x2018;Is your design for the sake of cost?&#x2019; and &#x2018;What impact will locating an electrical outlet here have?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>\n<p>CAPPA Dean Nan Ellin said the design/build studio has been popular. She said next year, CAPPA is working with the Tarrant County Housing Authority to design and build a single-family home in Arlington.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These kinds of projects help students understand certain elements of building sustainable urban communities, one of the pillars of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan,&#x201D; Ellin said.</p>\n<p>McCorkle also said the two tiny houses use high-efficiency HVAC units and will be sprayed with a high rated insulation. The units also have metal skins that reflect a large amount of radiant heat. Those metal roofs allow for the addition of rainwater harvesting and solar energy, he said.</p>\n<p>McCorkle said the units are mobile, too.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;You can take off the roofs and transport them,&#x201D; McCorkle said. &#x201C;In fact, we&#x2019;re seeing if we can afford to get them to the Earth Day event at Fair Park in April. Even if we can&#x2019;t move them there, we will have some sort of presence at the event.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>While CAPPA is still looking for sponsors or donors to help move one of the units for Earth Day or purchase the tiny houses, vendors have already contributed a lot for the projects.</p>\n<p>Audrey Poole, senior specifications project manager for Architectural Lighting Alliance or ALA, was giving presentations to the student teams last week on lighting options in the tiny houses.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I sure wish a program like this was around when I was a student here,&#x201D; said Poole, who has her&#xA0;undergrad and master&#x2019;s degrees from UTA.</p>\n<p>Besides ALA, other vendors donating time or materials include: Milgard Windows and Doors, Daikin, Huber Engineered Woods, Tom&apos;s Mechanical Inc., ABC Imaging, Delta Millworks and Topping Out.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington </span></b></p>\n<div>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

The CLEAR research team determined that under a wide range of conditions, multiple treatment modalities were required to remove pertinent contaminants, the presence of which can preclude oilfield waste from being recycled and reused.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As hydrocarbon extraction has expanded considerably across Texas, particularly in western Texas, so too has the reliance on fresh water resources to facilitate the stimulation of production wells,&#x201D; said Kevin Schug, interim associate dean of the College of Science and Director of CLEAR. &#x201C;This has provided a tremendous impetus for the recycling and reuse of produced waste, both of which are very difficult to accomplish effectively and economically given the physiochemical complexities of these waste solutions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Through this partnership with Challenger Water Solutions, we have been able to assess important organic, inorganic and biological constituents throughout the multi-step process, whereby we found that waste streams could be transformed into a resource for reuse by the oil and gas industry,&#x201D; he said.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s ongoing efforts will include developing therapies for the treatment of harmful bacteria in the water that are resistant to traditional forms of disinfection,&#x201D; added Dr. Zacariah Hildenbrand, co-founder and scientific contributor to CLEAR.&#xA0; A sponsored research agreement, the second within a year, from CWS to CLEAR, will pave the way for the development of new technology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Sulfate-reducing and iron-oxidizing bacteria are just two classes of bacteria that can wreak havoc in the oil and gas industry,&#x201D; Hildenbrand said. &#x201C;Bacterial contaminants can produce biofilms and corrosive agents, which can affect production and deteriorate infrastructure. The targeted chemical-free treatments that we are developing will not only ensure that recycled produced water is reusable, but they may also enhance oilfield recovery in production wells where biofouling is problematic.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&quot;The dynamic variable of produced water requires&#xA0;the best and brightest to break the barriers of cost, quality and consistency. Challenger Water Solutions has received validation and an&#xA0;expanded technology portfolio&#xA0;through the revolutionary thinking and expertise of UTA&apos;s multidisciplinary team,&quot; said Joel Warner, Technology Development Lead at Challenger Water Solutions.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These efforts clearly have tremendous implications in terms of greater environmental stewardship within the oil and gas industry,&#x201D; Schug concluded.</p>\n<p>To learn more about their work, visit <a href=\"http://clear.uta.edu\">http://clear.uta.edu</a></p>\n"

It could be used by the patients at home as an alternative therapeutic approach for them.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The two-year fellowship, which started Jan. 1, will pay for Young&#x2019;s salary, as well as provide funds for supplies and travel to scientific meetings to present his work.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s absolutely great to receive this grant.

He spent the next year there working in a laboratory environment under the direction of Penn State professor James Pawelczyk, who flew aboard the NASA STS-90 Space Shuttle mission in 1998 as a payload specialist.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;He was a mentor for me,&#x201D; Young said. &#x201C;During that experience, I really fell in love with the research process.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Young said his father is an electrical engineer and his grandfather had a doctorate in chemistry and contributed greatly to the theory and design of piezoelectric quartz devices.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;While I never really knew it growing up, having these kinds of role models in my life created an appetite for science,&#x201D; Young said.</p>\n<p>Young has great respect for UTA&#x2019;s Department of Kinesiology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The program at UTA is great,&#x201D; Young said. &#x201C;It is a very young program, which brings with it a lot of desire from investigators to succeed.

Students continue to meet the same rigorous academic standards. While instruction and class participation may look a little different in an online class, students continue to receive world-class preparation in a nationally ranked program.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Intelligent.com looked at more than 350 programs from 84 universities. UTA&#x2019;s online master&#x2019;s in education was the only Texas university in Intelligent.com&#x2019;s list and was also named as the best value among 30 state programs. Programs were accessed on three factors: academic strength, student engagement and return-on-investment potential.</p>\n<p>What makes UTA&#x2019;s online master&#x2019;s degree even more valuable is that it answers a critical shortage in the teaching profession according to the Texas Education Agency.</p>\n<p>Doughty said Texas and the nation continue to experience shortages in certain sectors, including English as a Second Language.</p>\n<p>Jeannie Winn, a&#xA0;K-2 reading interventionist at Liberty Elementary School, in Franklin, Tenn.,&#xA0;and a 2018 College of Education online master&#x2019;s degree graduate, said she was referred to UTA&#x2019;s online program through a colleague at work.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;During the entire online experience, I never felt left in the dark. The professors responded immediately to all of my questions and concerns. They were quick to respond and help guide me and the other students through each course,&#x201D; said Winn, who started college at 43. &#x201C;The course work prepared me to excel on my professional exam. The course work also prepared me to teach phonics and the foundational skills needed to support struggling readers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Winn also said the professors impressed her.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;They were so supportive through every course. They supported all of us in meeting the course goals,&#x201D; Winn said. &#x201C;The course prepared me for my current position. I have referred three colleagues to the program who have now started their coursework.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Doughty said, &#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s College of Education stands as a leader in high-quality educator preparation, especially in shortage areas. At the graduate and undergraduate levels, UTA prepares teachers in special education, bilingual/ESL and mathematics education. These represent three of the four shortage areas identified by the U.S. Department of Education and the Texas Education Agency.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Among the many successful graduates of UTA&#x2019;s online master&#x2019;s in education program is Shanna Peeples, M.Ed. &#x2019;13, who was named the 2015 National Teacher of the Year by the Council of Chief State School Officers.&#xA0; She was the first Texan to be named National Teacher of the Year since 1957.</p>\n<p>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said, &#x201C;Our best evidence for the great education UTA provides is from former students. The College of Education is extremely important to UTA&#x2019;s mission, especially since we are teaching the instructors of tomorrow. Our online master&#x2019;s program offers students the opportunity to prepare and advance on their terms, and with the support of our world-class faculty and staff.&#x201D;</p>\n"

We also plan to sharpen our focus on engineering ethics.

We feel like being known as the international civil engineering honor society better represents who we are.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Chi Epsilon&#x2019;s vision recognizes students and graduates for their academic achievements while seeking to foster excellence, connectivity and engagement among those in the civil engineering community to improve the world.</p>\n"

It is a program unit of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.</p>\n<p>Moazzeni said that when people are adversely affected by transportation, it hurts personal relationships, the ability to work and a household&#x2019;s economic bottom line.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If a family has to buy a car because mass transit is nowhere to be found, many times keeping, maintaining and operating that car can exceed the cost of public transit,&#x201D; Moazzeni said. &#x201C;Households could spend most of their money on cars, insurance and upkeep.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Moazzeni helped present two sessions. One was titled Planning Process and Environmental Justice. It investigated whether location matters in relationship to federal affordable housing programs and residents&#x2019; transportation affordability in North Texas.</p>\n<p>The second session was titled Pedestrian Planning, Modeling and Simulation. This study examined the impacts of street-level built environment and urban design qualities on walkability in downtown Dallas.</p>\n<p>Both studies presented are only a portion of the vast research being conducted by UTA in the fields of urban planning and transportation equity. CAPPA&#x2019;s Institute of Urban Studies is currently working with several cities across North Texas complex growth issues as the region moves closer to megacity status.</p>\n<p>Moazzeni became interested in transportation equity when she moved to North Texas for her doctorate.</p>\n<p>She said growing up in Isfahan, Iran, mass transit was available, but she found little coordinated mass transit in North Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Isfahan is a very compact city,&#x201D; said Moazzeni of the central Iranian city of 1.7 million. &#x201C;I started thinking how can I make this area a better place. That&#x2019;s how I became interested in transportation and how it affects people.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

As the CEO and treasurer, respectively, of Bioworld Merchandising Inc., both helped transform a business idea Raj had during his days at The University of Texas at Arlington into a global company recognized as a leader in the apparel licensing and branding industry.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption450\"><img alt=\"Vistasp Karbhari, Mona Malik, Raj Malik and Troy Johnson\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/malik-gift-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari, Mona Malik, Raj Malik and Troy Johnson,&#xA0;UTA&apos;s vice president of enrollment management, celebrate the $500,000 gift the Maliks gave UTA for a student scholarship endowment.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;I was raised by parents who instilled in me from an early age that it was virtuous to help everyone around you,&#x201D; Raj said. &#x201C;I want to make sure these scholarships enable students to pursue their dreams.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The University announced today that Raj and Mona have pledged $500,000 to establish a permanent scholarship endowment to fund need-based scholarships for students, including international students. The Maliks are now counted among the numerous donors who have made the dream of a college education possible for current and future students at UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is extremely fortunate to have the support of tremendous alumni and friends such as the Maliks. Raj&#x2019;s story from student to leader of industry is inspiring, and his spirit of entrepreneurship has already been the catalyst for so many of our students. The gift announced today will be transformational &#x2013; enabling current students to achieve their dreams and in doing so change not just their own lives but those of their families and the communities in which they reside,&#x201D; said President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m deeply grateful to the Maliks for paying it forward through this endowment and would like to thank them for providing hope and enabling the promise of a future for students at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Raj graduated from UTA in 1993 with a degree in computer science engineering. While he initially created the business plan for Bioworld in the early 1990s while a college student, it took persistence and commitment to launch the company in 2000. Irving-based Bioworld Merchandising Inc. is now averaging compound annual growth of over 20 percent and employs a workforce of more than 200. The company has licensing agreements with the major studios and intellectual property holders in the country, representing apparel, movie and entertainment brands. It recently acquired Global Design Concepts, expanding the company&#x2019;s reach into children&#x2019;s apparel and accessories across Europe and Asia.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I came from India directly to UTA when I was 19 years old and want to extend my sincere thanks to the entire UTA community &#x2013; the staff, students and faculty who supported me and helped make the transition seamless,&#x201D; Raj said. &#x201C;Although I was a computer science major, I drifted away from that area of study more than a few times, and the tremendous faculty supported me in all of my endeavors. They remain a group of educators dedicated to inclusiveness and accessibility for all. I can confidently state that I would not be here without their support.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Paying back their success is what makes their commitment to UTA all the more inspiring, and it is a major reason why the University is thriving as the third-largest producer of intellectual capital in Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I am thankful for the work Dr. Karbhari and his team are doing,&#x201D; Raj said. &#x201C;They are an outstanding representative of an American public institution of higher education. I am very proud to be a UTA alumnus and want to thank them for everything they have done for our family.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Rose Youngblood, interim vice president for development and alumni relations, said, &#x201C;Alumni support through private philanthropy is sending a very strong signal to our students. When students see they are going to graduate into a proud and faithful alumni family that gives back their time and their financial support, they become even more determined to achieve their goals. Raj and Mona&#x2019;s gift is a great example of the difference our alumni are making on campus today.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Last year, UTA awarded a record 12,746 degrees, the third most in the state and a 10.6 percent increase over 2015-2016. Enrollment reached almost 43,000 Texas-based students in the spring 2018 semester, a record high and a 2.4 percent increase over last spring, with a global total of more than 60,000 expected this academic year.</p>\n<p>Scholarships have become a vital piece of UTA&#x2019;s progress as a top-tier school of choice for students around the globe. The Rajeev and Ritu Malik Endowed Scholarship for Student Success will undoubtedly continue the University&#x2019;s forward momentum by attracting local and international students.</p>\n<p>With such rapid growth, opportunities abound to foster an environment of success for talented students at UTA, and the commitment of the Maliks demonstrates that giving back not only helps these students thrive but also has the potential to enrich our entire community by sparking new ideas that drive our economy and improve our quality of life.&apos;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- Written by Tommy White</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">&#xA0;&#xA0;</div>\n"

Bobadilla serves as assistant provost for Hispanic student success and senior associate vice president for outreach services and community engagement at The University of Texas at Arlington.</p>\n<p>The initiative&#x2019;s goal is to build a robust college-to-career pipeline between Hispanic-Serving Institutions, like UTA, and the corporations who partner with the Foundation, resulting in enhanced career readiness for students and an immediately employable talent pool for various industries.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The initial focus of University Partnerships will be to identify strong regional matches between universities, community colleges, and businesses working with Hispanic chambers of commerce across the state, and begin to network the entities and leverage shared resources,&#x201D; Bobadilla said. &#x201C;There are multiple reasons why UTA is the right institution to spearhead this effort.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington serves more Hispanic students than any other four-year public university in North Texas. UTA is one of only 10 universities in the nation to achieve the designation of both Hispanic-Serving Institution and R-1: Highest Research Activity in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.</p>\n<p>Bobadilla said she will immediately begin working with industry leaders to cultivate paid internship and real experiential learning opportunities. &#x201C;Internships are critical for career success and must be paid in order for students, many of whom are first generation and working their way through college, to be able to afford the opportunity,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p>Troy Johnson, UTA&#x2019;s vice president of enrollment management said, &#x201C;For UTA to be asked to spearhead this effort by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Foundation is proof of the pivotal role we&#x2019;re playing to ensure that America&#x2019;s students are career and workforce ready. The University Partnerships initiative will allow universities to nimbly answer the workforce needs of students and employers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Johnson will act as an adviser on the initiative, as will Linda Battles, Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board deputy commissioner and chief operating officer. THECB board member Arcilia Acosta will co-chair the initiative with Bobadilla.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The University Partnerships initiative aligns perfectly with 60x30TX,&#x201D; said Acosta. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve set a goal for at least 60 percent of Texans ages 25&#x2013;34 to have a certificate or a degree by 2030. We must accomplish this in order to fill the labor demands of industries in our state. We will not be able to arrive at that attainment goal if we don&#x2019;t focus on our Hispanic students and ensure they have multiple pathways for obtaining postsecondary degrees and credentials.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Only 25 percent of Latinos in Texas ages 25-34 currently have a postsecondary degree or certificate.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our 60x30TX plan is ambitious, but attainable, especially if higher education and the business community work more closely together than ever before,&#x201D; Battles said. &#x201C;The University Partnerships initiative directly addresses two goals of the plan &#x2014; marketable skills and student debt &#x2014; which are clearly in line with our larger goal of a more educated workforce. This will result in a distinct competitive advantage for Texas.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nina Vaca, chair of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Foundation, added, &#x201C;I am so proud that the USHCC Foundation has embarked on this legacy initiative with two such distinguished partners. With Texas as our launching point, our goal is to expand the University Partnerships initiative nationwide and to include as many university and corporate partnerships as possible.&#xA0; Our ultimate vision is to permanently impact the career trajectories of the next generation of Hispanic entrepreneurs and corporate leaders.&#x201D;</p>\n"

I congratulate Dr. Dasgupta on yet another honor in his remarkable career.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dasgupta, a native of India, was <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/08/Dasgupta%20Talanta%20Award.php\">previously named</a> the recipient of the 2017 Talanta Medal, an international award in the field of analytical chemistry. The Talanta Medal will be presented in March. In January, one of his papers was listed in <i>The Analytical Scientist</i> as among ten <a href=\"https://theanalyticalscientist.com/issues/0118/landmark-literature-part-i/\">landmark literature</a> papers in the discipline for 2017.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is a big thrill that this is happening and an honor to be among the other teachers and scholars who have received these awards,&#x201D; Dasgupta said.&#xA0; &#x201C;They have all left behind a cadre of very successful students, and that is what is most exciting to me.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The Distinguished Texas Scientist Award is particularly special because I&#x2019;ve spent all of my professional career in Texas,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m also touched that this is an award for a scientist, not a chemist, because while we often like to compartmentalize things, I&#x2019;m proud that the impact of my work is seen as going beyond the disciplines.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dasgupta, considered a pioneer in the field of ion chromatography, is perhaps most recognized for his work in iodine nutrition. He testified before Congress on the significance of perchlorate in women&#x2019;s breast milk. Perchlorate interferes with iodine uptake and iodine is the single most important element in thyroid hormones, which govern neurodevelopment.</p>\n<p>Among his lab&#x2019;s active research projects are an environmentally friendly analysis of arsenic in drinking water, the development of a NASA-funded ion chromatograph for testing extraterrestrial soil and the measurement of cyanide in saliva, blood and breath to more rapidly treat cyanide poisoning. Dasgupta says his lab &#x201C;fosters builders, not users.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The first recipient of the Texas Academy of Science&#x2019;s Distinguished Texas Scientist Award in 1979 was Dr. Michael DeBakey, a legendary heart doctor who is widely considered one of the greatest heart surgeons in history. Another recipient was Ilya Prigogine, who also received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>\n<p>Dasgupta is only the second UTA researcher to receive the Texas Academy of Science&#x2019;s Distinguished Texas Scientist Award. Jonathan Campbell, professor of herpetology and chair of the Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center at UTA, was named the 2003 Distinguished Texas Scientist. Since its inception in 1979, the award has been given to three times as many biologists as chemists.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Dasgupta is most deserving of this award, and the recognition is long overdue,&#x201D; Campbell said. &#x201C;This is an extremely rewarding honor because it not only recognizes his achievements, but it also means his peers in Texas have taken notice of the impact of his work.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dasgupta&#x2019;s father and grandfather were also educators. His family instilled in him a passion for discovery and education, which explains his love of teaching.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Awards are really just a reflection of what my students have done,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;To see enlightenment in their eyes &#x2013; nothing can replace that pleasure. Each and every one of them contributes something unique to my ideas. So, I can&#x2019;t take credit for these awards. In fact, I&#x2019;m thankful to all of my students because this recognizes what they have done.&#x201D;</p>\n"

This dynamic company is breaking new ground in a field of research that has the potential for developing a menu of antibody-based therapies that could benefit much larger numbers of cancer patients.</p>\n<p>Boehringer Ingelheim also awarded AbeXXa the company&#x2019;s Innovation Prize. The impact of this combination of events has enabled AbeXXa to accelerate its plans and grow its team of scientists from Texas to Boston, where AbeXXa now has a space at LabCentral&#x2019;s shared laboratory space in Cambridge &#x2013; the prize for winning the Innovation competition.</p>\n<p>Jon Weidanz, co-founder of AbeXXa, biology professor and associate vice president of research and interim director of UTA&#x2019;s North Texas Genome Center, underlined the significance of Boehringer Ingelheim&#x2019;s involvement in AbeXXa.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In just a little over a year, we&#x2019;ve become operational and, through the significant support of Boehringer Ingelheim, we have pulled something together that&#x2019;s very special. We&#x2019;re bringing our unique technology and know-how together with Boehringer Ingelheim&#x2019;s discovery and development expertise,&#x201D; Weidanz said. &#x201C;Everything has been set up for AbeXXa to be very successful and this, to a great extent, is due to the confidence that Boehringer Ingelheim has in our science and our team. We hope that through this partnership, together we will be able to apply our innovative science to reimagine the future of cancer treatment.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b>A menu-based approach to treatment </b></p>\n<p>What makes AbeXXa&#x2019;s research different is its effective treatment for a majority of patients by providing multiple combination options, tailored to each patient&#x2019;s tumor. Weidanz has worked in the immuno-oncology field for more than 25 years exploring how to utilize the immune system to attack cancer cells. &#x201C;Our idea was to go back and re-interrogate the immune system and explore which molecules are critical at regulating immune responses.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>AbeXXa&#x2019;s innovative approach is to tap into the diverse set of cancer-specific proteins that are contained within the cell, rather than just those that are expressed on the membrane. Other companies with research interests in this area focus on classical Human Leucocyte Antigens, or HLAs &#x2013; those that present antigens in a way that depend on the genetics of each person. AbeXXa is honing in on atypical HLAs which have much less variability.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This means we can envision therapies that target large numbers of patients with a particular cancer,&#x201D; Weidanz explains. &#x201C;We&apos;re finding a growing list of peptides that are presented by atypical HLAs. If you develop a number of antibody-based therapies against these, the patient&#x2019;s treatment will be an individualized combination of these therapies to suit their individual tumor signature.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b>Strong relationship with global pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim</b></p>\n<p>Relationships matter.</p>\n<p>And from the outset, Weidanz wanted to work with a partner he could trust in the journey to translate the scientific hypotheses into practice.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s about the network. You have a group of people you feel confident reaching out to who have been supportive over the years and through our long-standing relationship and alignment in goals, AbeXXa was the fit that Boehringer Ingelheim was looking for,&#x201D; Weidanz said.</p>\n<p>Cancer immunology is a major research focus for Boehringer Ingelheim, which has substantially increased its investment in this area and recently formed a new, global research department dedicated to exploring new ways of directing the immune system to profoundly affect the course of cancer.</p>\n<p>Set against this backdrop, the idea was born to invest in a company through the Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund, which could develop this early and challenging area of science. In parallel, the discovery research team also was exploring opportunities for collaboration. AbeXXa fit the bill on both counts.</p>\n<p>Paul Adam, head of Cancer Immunology Target Discovery within Boehringer Ingelheim, recognizes the partnership sweet spot with AbeXXa.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We saw very early on that AbeXXa was a company we could do great science with. We have a long-term commitment to oncology, and this opportunity to discover novel therapeutic antibodies supports our innovation strategy of exploring new target spaces. Our relationship with AbeXXa plays to each company&#x2019;s strengths and is a great example of how we can use a combination of investment and partnership tools to support early science innovation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Weidanz describes the partnership as a meeting of minds.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;One of the great things that AbeXXa has with Boehringer Ingelheim is a unique trust which starts with the leadership. We see a lot of support in trying to make the project work and a lot of intellectual input and exchange,&#x201D; Weidanz said. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s an academic feel to the relationship in terms of being inquisitive, curious and creative, but with a collegial approach to solving the problem &#x2013;&#xA0; how do we defeat cancer?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>National Council of Entrepreneurial Tech Transfer <a href=\"https://ncet2.org/\">https://ncet2.org/</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>&#xA0;</b></p>\n"

A leading producer has willingly partnered with an independent academic research group to provide continual environmental monitoring of an area in West Texas that has rich resources, but also delicate ecosystems.&#xA0;There are few industry-academic partnerships of this type.&quot;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Apache values the work of CLEAR and its ongoing study of water quality in the Alpine High region,&#x201D; said Navneet Behl, Apache&#x2019;s vice president of operations. &#x201C;Apache is committed to ensuring development is done in an environmentally responsible manner, and we&#x2019;ve taken a deliberate approach to ensure that.&#xA0; The work of capable, third-party institutions such as CLEAR is important to us and of benefit to all stakeholders in the region.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>To learn more about their work and to provide a charitable donation, visit <a href=\"http://clear.uta.edu\">http://clear.uta.edu</a>.</p>\n"

We are grateful for the relationship we enjoy with our campus community, and enjoy working together with students, faculty and staff, and countless other partners on and off our campus to ensure UTA is one of the safest places in Texas to live and learn.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The council compiled its rankings based on the FBI&#x2019;s Uniform Crime Reporting and the U.S. Department of Education&#x2019;s Campus Safety Security Survey. The lower the crime on campus and within the surrounding community, the higher a university was ranked.</p>\n<p>UTAPD uses high-tech policing tools such as data analytics to identify trends and allocate resources across campus. The department also employs security cameras, utilizes camera analytics software, deploys camera trailers in various spots across campus and uses license plate recognition software to identify and locate persons of interest. The University recently secured a low-interest loan through the Texas Comptroller&#x2019;s state energy conservation office to enhance lighting in parking lots.</p>\n<p>While technology adds an important extra layer to security efforts, UTAPD is vigilant about maintaining a visible presence and nurturing its already strong relationship with the campus community. Late night security escort services have been expanded and are available to all students, faculty and staff. UTAPD also launched MavWatch, a program that places students on patrol to provide courtesy escorts, assist visitors, report safety concerns and act as an additional set of eyes and ears looking for unusual activity. The department&#x2019;s annual National Night Out event has been recognized five consecutive years by the National Association of Town Watch.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTAPD is a leading agency in campus policing. We are investing in the latest technology without losing sight of the importance of walking the campus, seeing, being seen and getting to know the department&#x2019;s most important partners &#x2013; the students, faculty and staff,&#x201D; said John Hall, vice president for administration and campus operations. &#x201C;An excellent relationship with the Arlington Police Department further ensures our students&#x2019; safety in this great city.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTAPD was named the 2016 UT System Pacesetter Police Department of the Year, and Lemaux was appointed to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott. The commission establishes and enforces standards for Texas law enforcement, corrections and public safety telecommunications personnel.</p>\n"

Furthermore, 14 of the top 25 schools have an annual tuition of more than double that of UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s program provides great value for a high-quality education,&#x201D; Dombroski said, &#x201C;which is reflective of the goal of UTA&#x2019;s College of Business&#x2014;namely, to align ourselves with the needs of our core constituencies by delivering high-quality, innovative and distinctive educational programs at a cost that allows our students to achieve their professional goals without incurring unmanageable amounts of student debt.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>College Choice noted that UTA&#x2019;s master in human resource management program combines general business knowledge with a concentration in HR management. The curriculum involves 18 hours of required work in human resource management, with six hours focused on research and statistical methods for decision-making and problem-solving. Students can choose between a thesis (30 credits) and non-thesis plan of study (36 credits).</p>\n<p>Full-time students can graduate in two years and study HR analytics, talent management, total rewards, employment law, and HR consulting with a focus on applied skills.&#xA0; Graduates of the UTA MSHRM work at all the largest employers in DFW, several local governments, and non-profit organizations.&#xA0; Students have interned with such companies as Lockheed Martin, Texas Instruments and Bell Helicopter.</p>\n<p>Dombroski noted that he&#x2019;s &#x201C;very proud of the work&#x201D; that George S. Benson has done in growing the program. Benson is the chair of UTA&#x2019;s Department of Management and was director of the program from 2010 to 2018.&#xA0; Benson said UTA revised the curriculum in 2010 for the MSHRM program, emphasizing the added elements of analytics and quantitative decision-making in all the classes. He noted that UTA was one of the first universities to have a class in HR metrics and analytics. UTA also added an applied consulting class.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re very proud of our program that&#x2019;s in the company of some very distinguished universities,&#x201D; said Benson, who has been at UTA since 2002.&#xA0; &#x201C;We&#x2019;re also one of the more affordable programs. We&#x2019;ve worked hard to make sure that the curriculum is cutting-edge. We have a great set of scholar-practitioner faculty who bring a balance of academic and industry experience. We have an excellent group of students. We have industry partners who serve on our advisory board who have given us a lot of input on our curriculum to help make our students employable.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Additionally, Human Resources MBA recently recognized UTA&#x2019;s master in human resources program. The agency placed UTA No. 6 in its 2019 list of the &#x201C;20 Best Master&#x2019;s in Human Resources.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;HR as a field is growing in importance for companies to be able to compete for talent and manage organizational culture,&#x201D; Benson said. &#x201C;There are a lot of opportunities for students, and we feel like we&#x2019;re meeting their needs. We&#x2019;re still working on ways still to get better and improve. We would like to grow the program. We would like to generate more opportunities for our students with national employers coming in to recruit on campus.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our students are hungry for opportunities and hopefully these rankings will get the word out that people need to come to UTA to find HR talent.&#x201D;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Brandon George</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>\n"

Based on field research in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and northern and southern California, the study found that despite inconsistent resources and coordination problems, non-profits, religious groups, and businesses provided much-needed support and funding.</p>\n<p>Daniel Sledge, the study&#x2019;s co-author and a UTA associate professor of political science, said: &#x201C;For me, the most important aspect of our findings was the massive variation across counties in terms of the ability of non-profits to respond to disasters. This was particularly striking in Puerto Rico, where many areas simply did not possess the non-profit and volunteer resources necessary to fill in gaps in what government was doing.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>FEMA&#x2019;s National Response Framework assumes a crucial role for non-profits, religious groups, and businesses that are expected to fill in gaps in government&#x2019;s ability to respond. About 76 percent of non-profits surveyed for the study reported that had they not actively provided community services during and after the disaster, their services may not have been provided by someone else. Of those, only 16.9 percent believed the government might have stepped in and provided their services had the organizations not been active.</p>\n<p>After surveying 115 non-profits engaged in disaster response and engaging in 44 hours of interviews, the study concluded that voluntary organizations active in disaster, or VOADs, are critical to successful post-disaster coordination and recovery. VOADs bring together voluntary groups and representatives from local and state government agencies to coordinate actions, share information and target their efforts during and after disasters.</p>\n<p>The study found that these collaborative groups were most successful when they were already active before a disaster struck.</p>\n<p>In Sonoma County, Calif., local groups began building a VOAD after the 2017 wildfires but because it wasn&#x2019;t active before the disaster, non-profits and other groups faced serious challenges in coordinating their responses to the fires.</p>\n<p>However, in neighboring Napa County, voluntary groups reported strong coordination with each other and local government. As one non-profit representative said, &#x201C;the key difference here is that we had the [VOAD] in place and they [Sonoma] didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; The county&#x2019;s VOAD group was launched prior to the wildfires and was funded by a donation from the local vintners&#x2019; trade association following a 2014 earthquake.</p>\n<p>Herschel Thomas, the study&#x2019;s co-author and UTA assistant professor of political science, said: &#x201C;The big takeaway from our research is that these organizations need help. They are expected to do extraordinary things. By funding local Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters, the federal government can help to improve community capability to respond to disaster.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Scott Robinson, political science department chair at the University of Oklahoma, researches and is an expert in disaster politics, public and nonprofit management, and policy process theory.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Successful disaster and emergency response requires the participation of diverse organizations from public to private to nonprofit organizations - including some that don&apos;t think of themselves as an emergency response organizations.&#xA0;This research from Thomas and Sledge illustrates the often unrecognized contribution of nonprofit and religious organizations.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Cawthon, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Liberal Arts, said, &#x201C;Dr. Thomas and Dr. Sledge demonstrate a keen understanding of the reactions of community organizations and policy-makers to environmental disasters.&#xA0;Through their timely research via the NSF Rapid Response Grant, Dr. Sledge and Dr. Thomas showcase CoLA researchers&#x2019; skill in identifying problems and suggesting practical solutions.&#xA0;Dr. Sledge and Dr. Thomas are to be commended for their work as individual investigators, as well as their mentorship of several undergraduate and graduate students in this important project.&#x201D;</p>\n"

A femtosecond is one quadrillionth, or one millionth of a billionth, of a second.</p>\n<p>Maddalena previously earned a $1.01 million DURIP grant to support the design and construction of the new wind tunnel.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our research is making a critical contribution to the development of key technologies for hypersonic vehicles. These grants show that the Aerodynamics Research Center is at the cutting edge of research in this area and our long-term vision is being rewarded, first through our world-class facility and now with this additional funding to make the facility even more exclusive in its capabilities,&#x201D; Maddalena said.</p>\n<p>When hypersonic vehicles cruise through the atmosphere at 3,500 miles per hour or faster, friction causes them to heat up to more than 8,000 degrees Kelvin, or about 15,000 degrees Fahrenheit. At these temperatures, air also undergoes chemical reactions and nitrogen and oxygen molecules start to dissociate and form a reacting mixture of atomic oxygen and nitrogen, plus regular molecular oxygen and nitrogen. This superheated air, or plasma, flows around the vehicle and evolves as it does so, making it necessary for engineers to calculate simultaneously its chemistry and fluid dynamics to develop an effective heat shield.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption400\"><img alt=\"UTA wind tunnel diagram\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/maddalena-wind-tunnel-diagram.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>UTA wind tunnel diagram</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Current models are not able to accurately predict what will happen in every situation, so Maddalena and his team will use the fundamental research grant to develop diagnostic techniques to characterize the plasma flow, thereby improving the understanding of the relationship between arc-jet test and flight environments.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It generally takes about 10 years to develop a new heat shield for a hypersonic vehicle and part of it is due to the uncertainties associated with the arc-jet plasma flow,&#x201D; Maddalena said. &#x201C;In other words, you don&#x2019;t know at what exact conditions you&#x2019;re testing.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>For the Navy&#x2019;s specific applications, air density and skin friction on the hypersonic vehicle come into play, which can drastically change the performance of the thermal protection system. According to Maddalena, UTA is the only U.S. university with the ability to reproduce significant skin friction on the test articles with its facility.</p>\n<p>Since the flow in the wind tunnel will be heated beyond temperatures at which any type of physical measurement device placed in it would survive, the femtosecond laser system will allow Maddalena and his team to non-intrusively measure the temperature and composition of the plasma flow. The laser system is so advanced that it has never been used in an arc-jet facility and will take six months to build.</p>\n<p>The wind tunnel is housed in UTA&#x2019;s Aerodynamics Research Center, which boasts low-speed, transonic and supersonic wind tunnels and a hypersonic shock tunnel in addition to the arc-jet tunnel.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Maddalena continues to make a name for himself and for UTA, thanks to state-of-the-art diagnostics capabilities and the outlook for seminal contributions to fundamental research in hypersonics,&#x201D; said Erian Armanios, chair of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.</p>\n<p>Maddalena&#x2019;s research continues UTA&#x2019;s long history of leadership in aerodynamics and is an example of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020</a>, said UTA Engineering Dean Peter Crouch.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a tremendous opportunity to highlight excellence and national leadership in hypersonics.&#xA0;Dr. Maddalena&#x2019;s research is at the cutting edge of our developing fundamental understanding that is critical to U.S. leadership in the field.&#xA0;It&#x2019;s wonderful to see his research being acknowledged nationally and internationally as integral to meeting these challenges,&#x201D; Crouch said.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n"

Victoria Messerschmidt and Zach Bailey, two doctoral students, and Richard Bryant, who is seeking his master&#x2019;s degree, are helping Lee on the project.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are trying to understand biological forces through engineering,&#x201D; Lee said. &#x201C;This research is still in its basic stages, but what we learn now could someday allow doctors to pre-identify heart abnormalities and diagnose congenital heart conditions that could then be treated with gene therapy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Lee must build his microscope because none are commercially available that can capture 3-D motion plus time. Once it is built, he will inject the zebrafish with nanoparticles that attach where certain genes are expressed and track how genes affect ventricular development. He is using zebrafish because their bodies are transparent in the embryonic stage, so it is easy to see the nanoparticles without the use of magnetic resonance imaging.</p>\n<p>Lee will use his new microscope to create a 4-D model of a beating heart based on the images and genetic information collected from the fish, then apply computation models to that data to test his findings.</p>\n<p>This will include modifying the genes and using them to modulate contraction and hemodynamics or blood flow to see how changes in biomechanical forces affect gene development and then chamber development. In response to hemodynamic forces, ridges and grooves form in a wavelike pattern called a trabecular network in the direction of the blood flow. Too much or too little trabeculation can lead to defects with high mortality rates.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If we can understand the effects of biomechanical forces on the genes that cause ventricular chamber development, we can discern the optimized shape of the ventricle and best contraction rate.

In a prolapse, the pelvic floor muscles weaken and tear, allowing the vagina to stretch or expand and protrude on surrounding organs and structures. Treatment usually involves surgical implantation of mesh to repair the muscles, but the mesh often leads to severe complications that require extended recovery time and cause discomfort.</p>\n<p>Hong and his team are developing a strong, bioactive bioadhesive that is strong and bioactive to reattach the pelvic floor muscles early, before they detach completely, and stop further tearing while the body repairs the affected muscles.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A lot of women suffer from vaginal prolapse and it really affects their quality of life. Hopefully, our research will help women and ease their discomfort,&#x201D; Hong said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is difficult to repair a full muscle tear, but if a prolapse is detected early, we can glue the two edges together while they are still partially attached and prevent further damage. Because it is bioactive, the adhesive will allow the body to rejuvenate naturally, and there will be far less discomfort for the patient.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Hong&#x2019;s research is an example of health and the human condition, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, and of the ways that the University is making an impact on the community, said Michael Cho, chair of the Bioengineering Department.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a condition that affects women of all ages, and Dr. Hong and his team have a chance to make its treatment easier and less intrusive for those women. His ability to apply knowledge and techniques from previous research, as well as the strengths from the interdisciplinary team of investigators, will lead to success,&#x201D; Cho said.</p>\n<p>The Bioengineering Department has served North Texas for more than 40 years, with research strengths in bioinstrumentation, biomaterials and tissue engineering, biomechanics, medical imaging and nanomedicine/nanotechnology. The program was ranked No. 96 in the 2019 U.S. News &amp; World Report graduate rankings. UTA offers a joint program with UT Southwestern, one of the top medical schools in the country, and students can take courses and conduct research at either campus.&#xA0;UTA researchers have labs in UTSW&#x2019;s Bill and Rita Clements Advanced Medical Imaging Building for work on medical imaging projects. An undergraduate program was added in 2012. In 2017, the department won a&#xA0;National Institutes of Health T-32 grant to subsidize and train doctoral students in healthcare applications for nanotechnology, specifically to develop tools to battle cardiovascular and pulmonary ailments.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">--&#xA0;&#xA0;<i>Written by Jeremy Agor</i></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

The challenge is finding a way for air and fuel to mix and achieve combustion with such fast airflow, which Ground likens to trying to light a match &#x2013; and keep it lit &#x2013; during a hurricane.</p>\n<p>The Aerodynamics Research Center has existed at the university in one form or another since the 1930s when it was originally an aircraft maintenance and fabrication facility. The present facility was built in 1986, allowing a large expansion of equipment which now includes low-speed, transonic, supersonic, arc jet and hypersonic tunnels. Current research has focused on experimental high-speed and high-temperature aerodynamics, shock/boundary layer interaction, and detonation.

Jay Professor in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation at The University of Texas Arlington, co-authored the article, which was published in&#xA0;<a href=\"https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-016-1577-y\">The Malaria Journal</a>.</p>\n<p>Mauro Marrelli, who was a visiting professor at the college early in 2016, co-wrote the article. Marrelli, an internationally renowned entomologist, parasitologist and molecular biologist, currently is a professor of public health at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.</p>\n<p>Each year, malaria afflicts more than 500 million people in scores of countries around the world, killing more than 400,000, according to the World Health Organization.</p>\n<p>But Brotto said most studies on fighting malaria focus on the mosquito-borne parasite that causes the illness while ignoring the impact of the disease on skeletal muscles and the heart.</p>\n<p>Moderate or high levels of malaria infection typically affect skeletal muscles and the heart, Brotto said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Residual effects could be from the heart being weaker for some time to permanently suffering some damage,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Muscles are also very similar. If you develop chronic myopathy, it becomes harder to get in shape. The parasite takes away the normal ability of the blood cells to carry nutrients and oxygen to the body. That triggers the process of the demise.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He noted that even those with mild cases of malaria report a lot of muscle soreness and fatigue. He said people who eat healthy diets and exercise will be in a stronger position to vanquish the disease and to do so in a shorter amount of time.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There are interventions you could take prior to or in anticipation of an infection in order to improve the muscular and heart function,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;People would not feel so tired and so weak if they have a targeted intervention.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Examples of these interventions include anti-oxidant therapy through diet and medication. The authors recommend eating more uncooked fruits and vegetables and fiber as well as increasing protein intake through the consumption of meat, poultry, fish, legumes and protein shakes or powders, particularly those with some specific combinations of amino acid derivatives such as hydroxyl beta-methylbutyric acid or HMB.</p>\n<p>Exercise is a great tool for combating the infection, too, he said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The better shape you&#x2019;re in, the more prepared you will be to fight the infection,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>He said understanding strategies for treating malaria is more important than ever because Americans travel around the world in record numbers. Many visit countries where malaria is prevalent. In addition, more U.S. military personnel are deployed to regions where the disease is rampant, including South America, Africa and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Diseases increasingly transcend borders. This is a terrific example of how the work we do here at the college crosses borders,&#x201D; said Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation. &#x201C;Marco&#x2019;s work on malaria is a reminder that when we work to improve health and the human condition, we must look at how we can do it globally.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Improving health and the human condition is one of the four guiding themes of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020</a>: Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</p>\n<p>This study builds on a previous study by Brotto and Marrelli that showed that malaria infection caused muscle degradation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Even more specifically, it causes degradation of proteins in the muscles responsible for contraction,&#x201D; Brotto said. &#x201C;We were the first to reveal that. Many other studies have replicated our original research. For this paper, we reviewed all the literature related to malaria and the effects of malaria on muscles and the heart. Our plan is to continue our studies with some new genetic markers we recently obtained together in studies between our labs and submit a joint grant proposal to expand these studies since they also could have applications to muscle diseases.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About the UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation</span></b></p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/index.php\">College of Nursing and Health Innovation</a> is a National League for Nursing Center of Excellence and encompasses one of the nation&#x2019;s largest and most successful nursing schools and a renowned kinesiology program offering degrees in exercise science, kinesiology, athletic training and an undergraduate track in public health.

Besides political developments, Narrett&#x2019;s book evaluates trade, settlement projects involving slave and free labor, and military incursions by Anglo-American adventurers into Spanish and Indian territories.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I examined the clash of empires and nationalities from the diverse perspectives of Native Americans and of the competing Spanish, French, British, and Anglo-American forces,&#x201D; Narrett explained. &#x201C;During a time of great transition, the Louisiana and Florida frontiers were embroiled in turbulent international politics and experienced tremors from both the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolution.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He added: &#x201C;By demonstrating the pervasiveness of intrigue and betrayal in borderland rivalries, <i>Adventurism and Intrigue</i> shows that U.S. continental expansion was not an inevitable progression; my research redefines the important role the Louisiana and Florida borderlands had within the changing map of North America.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>For his book, Narrett researched Spanish, British, French and U.S. documentary sources in numerous archives, including the Library of Congress, and collections in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Philadelphia, Chicago, New York City and Ottawa, Canada.<i>&#xA0; </i>By using these original sources in several languages, Narrett is able to tell the story of frontier conflicts and intrigue through the voices of diverse nationalities.&#xA0; He also brings out the human dimension and drama that pervaded areas where individuals and groups commonly changed allegiances by adapting to changing circumstances.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption200\"><img alt src=\"/news/images/narrett-book-cover.jpeg\" width=\"200\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p><i>&#x201C;</i>Elites &#x2013; those in leadership positions&#x2013; occupy a major place in my book,&#x201D; Narrett states. &#x201C;Such individuals did not simply control events, however, and their failures were as common as their successes. Indeed, unrealized ambitions are critical to understanding historical alternatives and outcomes.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Cawthon, associate dean of the UT Arlington <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/libarts/\">College of Liberal Arts</a>, called the book an important contribution to scholarship.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Narrett has produced a masterful book that contributes to several fields and eras of history. &#xA0;His research highlights the strengths of the history department in borderlands scholarship,&#x201D; Cawthon said. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>In a review of the book, Andrew McMichael, assistant dean and associate professor of history at Western Kentucky University, said one strength of <i>Adventurism and Empire</i> is the broad diversity of the sources upon which Narrett draws.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Many American historians, and a surprising number of borderlands historians, avoid foreign-language sources. That Narrett was able to use these to the extent that he has sets this work apart,&#x201D; McMichael said.</p>\n<p><i>Adventurism and Empire: The Struggle for Mastery in the Louisiana-Florida Borderlands, 1762-1803</i> is available at the UT Arlington bookstore, 400 S.

UTA was one of only 13 programs to receive an A+ for its early reading instruction. The report also gave the University an A for teaching proper classroom management skills.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;One reason UTA elementary education students are so well prepared is their extensive classroom teaching experience,&#x201D; Doughty noted. &#x201C;These students spend nearly 200 hours in local elementary school classrooms prior to their 17 weeks of full-time student teaching. We plan to build upon these impactful practices to include additional early field experiences and service learning.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>State Sen. Kelly Hancock, R-North Richland Hills, said, &#x201C;The importance of a quality education is one thing all Texans can agree on.&#xA0; UTA is doing its share to ensure classrooms are equipped with highly trained teachers which gives young students every possible advantage. I applaud UTA&#x2019;s tireless efforts.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The College of Education is a top producer of highly effective teachers in the state with an especially large concentration of graduates in North Texas. Eighty-nine percent of the College&#x2019;s graduates are hired in the Dallas/Fort Worth region and their teacher attrition rates are the lowest in the area, according to a 2016 report from the Houston-based Center for Research, Evaluation, and Advancement of Teacher Education. That report also found that more than 82 percent of UTA-prepared teachers remain in the classroom after five years, well above the state average of 72.5 percent.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/college-of-ed-teacher-prep.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&quot;My goal for the college is that we continue to have a positive impact on the metroplex and beyond through new programs and ongoing collaboration with our PreK-12 partners,&quot; Doughty said. &quot;Our local schools have specifically expressed a need for greater teacher preparation in both bilingual education and special education. Thus, we will offer undergraduate coursework leading to certification in bilingual education/ELL (English Language Learning) and special education this fall and launch a master&apos;s program in special education in January 2018 to address the critical demand for teachers in these areas.&quot;</p>\n<p>Doughty noted that the College is also partnering with two local school districts to open teacher academies. More than 150 high school students per year will enter those programs and will be guaranteed teaching positions in their school districts once they successfully complete their coursework and graduate from UTA.</p>\n<p>In addition to teachers, the College of Education produces a large number of superintendents, principals and administrators through robust on-campus and online degree certification offerings. Valuecolleges.com listed UTA&#x2019;s online Master of Education program No. 2 on its Top 50 Best Value Online Graduate Education Programs. The online graduate programs are also ranked No. 56 nationally and third highest in Texas by&#xA0;<i>U.S. News and World Report.</i></p>\n<p>&#x201C;On the educational continuum, we consider PreK-12 educators, community colleges and adult learning programs to be equally engaged and committed partners on our journey to producing the intellectual capital our state needs for a healthy future,&#x201D; UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said. &#x201C;We provide school districts with a talented pipeline of highly qualified teachers and administrators, and through innovative research, our nationally recognized faculty shape educational policy at all levels.

It affects more than 200 million people worldwide, mostly in tropical and subtropical areas and especially in poor communities without access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.</p>\n<p>Epidemiologists in China and other countries have been studying schistosomiasis and attempting to eliminate it for more than a decade. They have been able to achieve eradication rates of 99 percent in some areas, but the disease has resisted being wiped out entirely.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We want to find out what it is about this disease that allows it to persist even in the face of aggressive control measures,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s important to get rid of schistosomiasis, but the scope of the project is much larger than learning how to eliminate this disease in any one area of the world.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The real importance of the study is in learning why we can&#x2019;t totally eliminate this parasitic disease, and then using that knowledge to help guide eradication campaigns for this and other parasitic diseases elsewhere. There&#x2019;s something about transmission patterns that perpetuate this disease that we don&#x2019;t understand yet. We want to know what&#x2019;s unique about the biology of this and other parasitic diseases in the end-game, when control has been fairly effective at reducing the disease but eradication cannot be achieved.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Castoe is working on the project with principal investigator Elizabeth Carlton and co-investigator David Pollock, both from the University of Colorado School of Medicine. Castoe spent five years as a postdoctoral fellow in Pollock&#x2019;s lab prior to coming to UTA in 2012.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Carlton contacted Dr. Pollock for help on the project, and he got in touch with me because the research I&#x2019;ve been doing to generate genome data from many individual samples complemented their goals well,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;Using genomic sequencing, this project will provide unprecedented insight into the detailed patterns of transmission across hosts, across geographic areas and through time. This will help us to understand how to prevent infections and advance efforts to achieve permanent reductions in schistosomiasis and other human helminthiases [worm infections].&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The parasites that cause schistosomiasis live a portion of their life in certain types of freshwater snails. The infectious form of the parasite, known as cercariae, emerges from the snail into the water, which then infects people during routine agricultural, occupational and recreational activities. Lack of proper hygiene and activities of school-aged children such as swimming or fishing in infested water make them especially vulnerable to infection.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Illustration of aims of the research program\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/castoe-nih-project-2019.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Hypothesized sources of new schistomiasis infections in residual transmission hotspots to be investigated by the specific aims of the research program.

He is on the cutting edge of the field and one of the things that is so great about having him on the team is that he is always thinking about how we might leverage the latest advances in genomic sequencing to answer our research questions efficiently and effectively.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Carlton explained that the researchers are using new genomic sequencing technologies to map the ancestry of parasites, in an effort to identify human or animal hosts that may be acting as sources of new infection. They are following human and animal populations over time, testing them for infection and measuring risk factors.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re looking at new areas of infection, hotspots where we can&#x2019;t eliminate it,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;Many of the things we learn in this project could apply globally, to various parasitic diseases in many low- and middle-income countries. That&#x2019;s the goal.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>College of Science Dean Morteza Khaledi praised the work that Castoe and his colleagues are doing and said it has the potential to have a far-reaching impact on health and the human condition, one of the main pillars of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Castoe is a leader in the field of genome sequencing and this project will benefit greatly from his expertise in this area,&#x201D; Khaledi said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s possible that the work he and his colleagues are doing in this study could be applied worldwide and be of tremendous benefit in the fight against parasitic diseases.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Castoe also has two other major federally funded projects underway, both involving genomic studies of snakes but seeking to answer fundamentally different questions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Todd Castoe lab\" id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/castoe-lab.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Members of Todd Castoe&apos;s lab</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p><b>NSF project to understand the roles of selection and gene flow in speciation in rattlesnakes</b></p>\n<p>The first of these projects, titled &#x201C;Systematics, introgression and adaptation in Western Rattlesnakes: A model system for studying gene flow, selection and speciation,&#x201D; is funded by a four-year, $867,402 grant from the National Science Foundation&#x2019;s Division of Environmental Biology. Castoe is principal investigator; co-PIs are Matthew Fujita, UTA associate professor of biology; Stephen Mackessy, professor in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Northern Colorado; and Jesse Meik, assistant professor of biological sciences at Tarleton State University, who earned a Ph.D. in Quantitative Biology from UTA in 2009.</p>\n<p>The research focuses on the Western Rattlesnake and its close relatives as a model system to study the fundamental process of species formation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Despite substantial research, the roles of natural selection in the formation of species and in preventing hybridization between species remain poorly understood,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;In a rapidly changing world, there is an urgent need to understand the importance of these processes in species formation and the impact of these processes on how scientists identify and name species.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The researchers will study genetic, venom protein and anatomical data to test how natural selection shapes and maintains species, then use the results to test several approaches for appropriately identifying species in nature.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Essentially, we&#x2019;re using rattlesnakes as a model to understand how some important features of speciation work in nature,&#x201D; Castoe said.</p>\n<p>Previous studies have disagreed about how many species should be recognized within this group of snakes, and different populations can produce diverse symptoms from snake bites due to differences in venom biochemistry, the researchers explained. Their goals are to resolve these issues by developing a new system for understanding and appropriately recognizing species; providing new insight into the process of species formation; developing new methods for identifying species; and refining the appropriate medical treatment of snakebites in North America.</p>\n<p>The project also includes a public outreach program, which will include educational tools and will be conducted at the Dallas and Denver Zoos, thereby reaching millions of visitors per year.</p>\n<p><b>NSF project on regulation of intestinal form, function, and regeneration</b></p>\n<p>The second project, titled &#x201C;Collaborative Research: Integrated mechanisms underlying the regulation of intestinal form and function,&#x201D; is funded by a four-year, $1.2 million grant from the NSF&#x2019;s Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.</p>\n<p>Castoe is principal investigator and is joined in the study by co-principal investigator Saiful Chowdhury, UTA associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Stephen Secor, professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, who is leading concurrent research.</p>\n<p>Vertebrates exhibit a broad range of physiological capacities to alter intestinal performance that are adaptively linked to their feeding habits. This project&#x2019;s goal is to understand how and why some vertebrates&#x2014;including snakes that sometimes go long periods between meals&#x2014;experience rapid changes in intestinal form and function when feeding, and subsequent intestinal atrophy following the completion of digestion. This is in sharp contrast with snakes that feed more often and experience only modest change in intestinal form and function.</p>\n<p>For the widely regulating Burmese python, for example, it is known that feeding triggers the differential expression of more than 1,000 intestinal genes. These snakes experience extreme regenerative intestinal growth with every major meal, and understanding how any vertebrate might accomplish such feats could be key to understanding how to direct regenerative growth in other vertebrates, like humans.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the structural and functional flexibility of the intestine, and whether such mechanisms are shared across vertebrates that similarly widely or narrowly regulate intestinal performance,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;By leveraging the extreme range in intestinal responses exhibited by snakes and other vertebrates and recently available genomic resources, this research program will identify the underlying mechanisms of intestinal flexibility and test if these mechanisms are shared or unique across lineages and regulatory phenotypes.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Ultimately, studying other vertebrates that exhibit regenerative intestinal growth could lead to breakthroughs in learning how to control regeneration in human tissues.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The researchers are addressing these broad questions by pursuing three aims. First, they are seeking to identify the cellular and structural mechanisms that underlie the modulation of intestinal form and regeneration, and whether form strictly dictates the regulation of intestinal function. Second, they&#x2019;re trying to link transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms to phenotypic changes in intestinal structure and function. Third, they want to test whether shared or unique sets of molecular mechanisms drive similar phenotypic responses among vertebrates.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Studying gene expression alone does not provide the complete picture of the function of a system. The expression and modification of proteins play significant roles in cellular functions,&#x201D; Chowdhury said. &#x201C;We are extracting proteins from the intestinal tissues of snakes and sequencing them using mass spectrometry. Using the same mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we are also identifying the phosphate modification sites in proteins. Intestinal-tissue proteomics analysis, before and after feeding, is helping us to understand the protein interaction network and signaling cascades linked to intestinal regeneration in snakes.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Chowdhury believes this project is the first to combine genomics and proteomics information to understand the molecular mechanisms which drive major shifts in intestinal function in snakes.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Ultimately, this research will identify the signaling and structural mechanisms by which vertebrates modulate intestinal form and function, and identify pathways that all vertebrates appear to possess that may direct intestinal regeneration capacity,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;We want to understand how vertebrates control, at the molecular level, shifts in intestinal form and function, and test if the regenerative capacities seen in some extreme vertebrate examples, like snakes, could be translated to other vertebrates such as humans.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Together, the NSF projects take advantage of the huge advances made in genome sequencing technology to tackle questions about the processes that drive diversity in form and function in nature. A number of the potential findings of these basic research studies have broad ramifications for understanding human genomic diversity and human health.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;With both of these NSF projects, we&#x2019;re using genomics to answer fundamental questions about biology,&#x201D; Castoe said.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Greg Pederson</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n"

This resulted in faster run times but,\nparadoxically, violated Newton&#x2019;s second law upon which the conventional model\nwas based. The remedy for this paradox was to argue that mass was unimportant\nat the nano-scale.</p>\n<p>However, the new model retains mass, and predicts unexpected\nmotion of nano-sized objects in a fluid that has been experimentally observed.\nThe new model also runs much faster than both the conventional and massless\nmodels.</p>\n<p>It is expected that this new model will significantly accelerate\nresearch involving small-scale phenomena.</p>\n<p>Research areas that Bowling and collaborators at UT Arlington are\ncurrently investigating include cell migration, protein function, bionic\nmedical devices and nanoparticle suspensions for storing thermal energy.\nHowever, the applications for the computer simulation in medicine, biology, and\nother fields are endless.</p>\n<p>The research is detailed in the paper&#xA0;<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11071-013-1185-0\">&#x201C;Dynamics\nof Microscopic Objects in Optical Tweezers: Experimental Determination of\nUnderdamped Regime and Numerical Simulation using Multiscale Analysis&#x201D;</a>&#xA0;and\npublished online by the&#xA0;<i>Journal of Non-Linear Dynamics.&#xA0;</i>The\npaper is scheduled for publication in the journal&#x2019;s print version later this\nyear.</p>\n<p>Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/\" title=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/index.php\">College of Engineering</a>,\nsaid the team&#x2019;s findings may alter ways of thinking throughout the engineering\nand scientific worlds.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The paper is only the beginning for this research,&#x201D; Behbehani\nsaid. &#x201C;I anticipate a high level of interest in the findings.

        "body": "\n<p>A UTA mechanical engineer has partnered with a long-time friend from his home nation of South Korea to help find a more effective way for steelmaking companies to inspect and maintain their facilities.</p>\n<p>Daejong Kim, a University of Texas at Arlington associate professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, was awarded an $80,000 grant in January from South Korea-based POSCO&#x2014;one of the world&#x2019;s largest steelmakers&#x2014;to help fund a one-year feasibility study of intelligent robot systems for inspection and maintenance of steelmaking facilities.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Daejong Kim\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/daejong-kim-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Daejong Kim</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Kim, who has worked at UTA since 2008, is collaborating closely with POSCO senior principal researcher Kihwan Kim on the project. The two have been friends for almost 25 years after meeting in graduate school at Seoul National University.</p>\n<p>Kihwan Kim, who has worked at POSCO for 10 years, has come to UTA and will be on campus for the entire year to help with the feasibility study as a business scholar.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Steelmaking companies like POSCO have such large and complex production facilities, similar to petrochemical plants,&#x201D; Kihwan Kim said. &#x201C;The companies always seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of inspection and maintenance of those facilities. Recent developments of intelligent robot technologies have drawn our attention greatly. Through this project, I hope to find some great ideas of robot applications for steelmaking facilities. Particularly, we will focus on robotics for harsh and hazardous environments such as high temperature, strong radiation and severe dust.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Daejong Kim said robots could certainly be valuable to help at steelmaking facilities.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Underneath these plants is a huge maze of electrical wires,&#x201D; Daejong Kim said. &#x201C;When there is too much of an overload in electrical wires a fire can start, and once that happens it&#x2019;s difficult to control because of the toxic gas underground&#x2014;it&#x2019;s highly combustible. Even firefighters have difficulty going in. We want to develop some kind of robotic system that can go in and monitor the temperature, and if the wires get too hot the robot can detect and monitor the location of the high-temperature spot and avoid a fire hazard. The robot should be able to avoid obstacles in front of it, carry infrared cameras, and have arms and legs and multiple sensors to detect the problems.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not developing an actual robot now,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;Once the feasibility study is done, the next step is to develop the robot. The study is identifying what kind of functionality is needed with the robot.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Daejong Kim moved from South Korea to the United States in 2000 and received his doctorate degree from the University of Texas at Austin.</p>\n<p>Kihwan Kim believes Dr. Kim is the right person to lead this feasibility study.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I would like to achieve practice results rather than just theoretical ideas, and Professor Kim has lots of experience in industrial application, which has been very successful,&#x201D; Kihwan Kim said. &#x201C;So, I found that his strength could fit nicely to our goal. I also found out that UTA has strong traditions of engineering, including great people and facilities. It has been a great pleasure to work together with UTA researchers so far.&#x201D;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Brandon George</em></p>\n"

The Institute helps cities, school districts, counties and other entities with planning, surveys and research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our findings, combined with earlier meta-analyses, suggest that single family housing may not be the best residential use in areas very close to transit,&#x201D; Hamidi said. &#x201C;Possibly, increasing zoning entitlements for these properties will increase values by giving homeowners the options of selling their property for more money, or converting their properties to more compatible uses. Current zoning and building codes make these types of property conversions difficult or impossible to accomplish legally in most locations.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The meta-analysis gathered information from 114 studies dating back to 1967.

Because of genetic differences between people, this immune response is unique to each individual.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This knowledge could be harnessed to treat diseases caused by an imbalance in the relationship between the host and the communities of bacteria in their intestine, otherwise known as gut dysbiosis,&#x201D; said Jason Kubinak, a new UTA assistant professor of biology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We can now imagine a world where oral vaccines or probiotics could be used to bolster natural defenses or control infection, reducing our need for long-term steroid or antibiotic use, both of which can have serious negative side-effects,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>Kubinak published the review paper, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v16/n12/full/nri.2016.114.html\">&#x201C;Do antibodies select a healthy microbiota?&#x201D;,</a> as the cover article of the prestigious journal <i>Nature Reviews: Immunology</i>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>He and his co-author June Round, associate professor of pathology at the University of Utah, termed this process by which the immune system releases antibodies to promote healthy microbial communities &#x201C;antibody-mediated immunoselection&#x201D; or AMIS.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We believe that going forward it will also be possible to develop immunotherapies based on antibodies that can manage bacterial communities to prevent illness,&#x201D; Kubinak said. &#x201C;This could be particularly important for more sensitive patients, such as those suffering diseases associated with primary or secondary immunodeficiencies.&quot;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/immunology-graphic.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Potential immunotherapies to modulate antibody-mediated immunoselection in the gut</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>In addition to their own research, Kubinak and Round reviewed a series of studies that demonstrate how the major gut antibody, called immunoglobulin A or IgA, targets resident bacteria and helps define the composition of bacterial communities in the intestine.

        "body": "\n<p>As some nations continue to develop and test long-range, hypersonic missiles capable of reaching speeds beyond Mach 10, it becomes increasingly important for the United States to develop defense systems to engage and destroy such missiles.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Winning design\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/arx-student-missile-design-tn.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>A UTA aerospace engineering student team crafted a winning design for a conceptual missile system.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>A University of Texas at Arlington aerospace engineering student team that crafted a winning design for a conceptual missile system to deploy against such threats led to a mention in the December 24-January 13 issue of <i>Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology</i>.</p>\n<p>The team &#x2013; doctoral students James Peace, Rohit Pulimidi, master&#x2019;s graduates Nirmal Kumar Umapathy and Mohit Singh, and their advisers, UTA aerospace engineering professor Frank Lu and the late Harry Barnard of Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control &#x2013; created its design for the 2016-17 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, or AIAA, Missile Systems Technical Committee Design Competition. After winning the competition, the students presented a paper based on their findings at the 2018 AIAA Space and Astronautics Forum, where it caught the attention of Aviation Week writer Steve Trimble.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Hypersonic weapon systems have been in the news recently, with various adversaries independently conducting tests of hypersonic glide vehicles or HGVs, and there are currently no existing weapons system to defend against them now,&#x201D; Peace said. &#x201C;Many defense companies are focused on developing a hypersonic weapon, but only limited progress has been made toward a deployable counter-weapon.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The winning design was a single-stage &#x201C;hit-to-kill&#x201D; missile system, named ARX, to intercept hypersonic glide vehicles, or HGVs, during cruise. HGVs are launched as payloads atop conventional launch vehicles, separate at the top of the launch arc, then glide through the atmosphere in a series of banks and weaves. Complicating matters, the altitude of the flight path and geometric constraints due to the Earth&#x2019;s curvature keep the HGVs out of sight of ground-based radar equipment until the vehicle crests the horizon, leaving little time for defenses to react.</p>\n<p>The conceptual design relied on a mathematical model that integrated the aerodynamic characteristics, propulsion sizing, and structural constraints with the missile guidance and trajectory algorithm. The team also developed several engineering tools, custom-made for the problem at hand, to aid the conceptual design.</p>\n<p>Ideally, ARX is capable of defending a several mile radius against non-maneuvering and maneuvering HGVs at a high altitude and at a high speed. The missile is equipped with a blast fragmentation feature to increase its lethality, so that even if the missile fails to hit the HGV, there is a chance that the fragments will hit and neutralize the HGV.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I really believe that this is a good concept that would actually work. This competition brought out a lot of talent and imaginative ideas,&#x201D; Lu said.</p>\n<p>The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering offers bachelor&#x2019;s, master&#x2019;s and doctoral degrees in mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering. The aerospace engineering program ranked No. 48 and the mechanical engineering program, No. 87, in U.S. News and World Report&#x2019;s 2019 graduate rankings. The FSAE, or Formula Society of Automotive Engineering, program has a storied past. Dating back 45 years, UTA has taken three international and eight national championships and has debuted innovative changes in the automotive industry, including wings to reduce drag and an all-electric racecar. The Aerodynamics Research Center houses the only university-housed, arc-heated hypersonic wind tunnel in the United States, as well as low-speed, transonic, supersonic, arc jet and hypersonic shock wind tunnels.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>\n"

TRIO includes programs that target and assist students through an academic pipeline from middle school to post-baccalaureate programs. More than 840,000 students &#x2014; from sixth-graders to college graduates &#x2014; are served by more than 2,900 programs nationally.</p>\n<p>TRIO pre-college programs were first funded at UTA through the Upward Bound program in 1982. Eight additional competitive grants have been awarded to the University since then for continued funding. Most recently in 2017, the Upward Bound Math and Science program in Dallas was funded.</p>\n<p>For Sergio Gutierrez, a 2014 UTA mechanical engineering graduate who now works at Lockheed Martin, the positive results from the Upward Bound program were substantial.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I always considered myself a hard-working and bright student,&#x201D; Gutierrez said. &#x201C;Upward Bound continued to promote those good habits and traits and built on them. They helped me with whatever questions I had and advice leading into college. As a first generation American this was key because no one in my family had gone to college in America before me. My parents do have degrees but in Mexico and the process there is different.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Gutierrez said Upward Bound helped him earn a four-year scholarship and find funding for two UTA summer classes covered by the program.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t as worried about the finance of school because of grants and that financial aid. Overall, Upward Bound was a great support system, similar to a family. It provides a cultural enrichment of activities via trips and field work to other parts of the country during the summer program.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In TRIO, each student participant works with a student development specialist to explore his or her current academic needs and the resources available, then develops a plan of action. The specialists are knowledgeable of UTA&#x2019;s and other colleges&#x2019; and universities&#x2019; requirements and expectations. They help the participants find solutions to problems they may encounter.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The coaching and mentoring these participants receive are individualized,&#x201D; said Lisa Thompson, senior director for pre-college programs. &#x201C;One student might need more help in the academic realm. Another might need more help in finances for college. Still another might require personal and social coaching.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In addition to coaching, forums are held on academic and life-skills learning, financial education and other important topics. Finally, participants are prepared for university rigors through peer-assisted study sessions and tutoring.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our staff has a real heart for the students served by the TRIO programs,&#x201D; Thompson said. &#x201C;You can see that in the positive results we get with our participants. Many of them go on to earn advanced degrees. That helps them. It helps UTA. But, more importantly, it helps society.&#x201D;</p>\n"

Heidi Taboada, associate dean for research and graduate studies in UTEP&#x2019;s College of Engineering, is principal investigator in the USDA grant.</p>\n<p>UTA professors Nick Fang, assistant professor of civil engineering; Jaime Cantu and Shouyi Wang, assistant professors of industrial, manufacturing and systems engineering; Hristo Kojouharov, math professor; and Wen Shen, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering form the rest of the principal investigating team.</p>\n<p>UTA will recruit a team of graduate and undergraduate students to form a Smart Agriculture learning community and will manage the learning community through teaching, research and mentoring.</p>\n<p>Su and his team will be able to advise and mentor students individually in the form of meetings, seminars and other organized activities with the entire Smart Agriculture cohort so that students will be adequately prepared academically and in professional development. UTA will enhance the Smart Agriculture Learning Community through experiential learning, internship and research opportunities.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve already recruited four students and are pursuing research in three different directions,&#x201D; Su said. &#x201C;The first research project is with Nick Fang and we&#x2019;ll be looking at using unmanned aircraft vehicles, or drones, to take images of the agricultural fields while collecting a large amount of data that will help farmers to know ground moisture levels and crop growth.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Shen and Kojouharov will oversee the second project that involves using small biosensors to detect the presence of bacteria, contamination and moisture levels on any crop. The sensors will also provide the necessary data that will better assist with food safety and storage, and increase productivity with less human intervention with the food products, Su said.</p>\n<p>UTA will involve all Smart Agriculture students in experience learning and research in data science related to the USDA mission. The faculty team will continue to recruit graduate and undergraduate students each year for research projects related to water, food, nutrition and other agriculture-focused research. The faculty team also will seek partners for internship opportunities for Smart Agriculture students.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;With urban farming, the experimental field is very limited and there are questions about making decisions using data because certain products may take a longer time to grow and you don&#x2019;t have space to grow other things, versus other food products that have a much quicker turnaround time,&#x201D; Su said. &#x201C;That leaves room for optimization and Dr. Cantu and Dr. Wang are involved in designing that process that can potentially lead to making better decisions with benefits to customers in mind.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Su&#x2019;s USDA grant leans heavily on two of the themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, building sustainable communities and data-driven discovery, said Morteza Khaledi, dean of the College of Science.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The work and research that these professors and students will perform will make better use of the land and help farmers and, in the long run, consumers of those agricultural products,&#x201D; Khaledi said.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s Department of Mathematics is the recipient of 2013 American Mathematics Society Award for an Exemplary Program or Achievement in a Mathematics Department. With the support of U.S. Department of Education-supported Graduate Assistance for Areas of National Need program for graduate students, the National Science Foundation&#x2019;s System for Undergraduates to Reach Goals in Education program for undergraduate students and the NSF Math Bridge-to-Doctorate program, UTA Mathematics is a national leader in education, research and mentoring, serving a diverse population of students.

Co-principal investigators are Marilyn Brandt, research associate professor of marine and environmental science at the University of the Virgin Islands, and Erinn Muller, staff scientist at the Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium in Sarasota, Fla.</p>\n<p>During the past three decades, environmental changes &#x2013; including global warming &#x2013; have likely led to the sharp increase in coral disease in reefs around the world. Unhealthy coral reefs cannot support the fish and other forms of life that make reefs such vibrant and diverse ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea are disease hotspots and many reefs have experienced population collapses due to outbreaks of disease, Mydlarz explained. Coral species vary in their susceptibility to disease, but the reasons behind this variation are unknown.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Coral diseases don&#x2019;t affect all coral species in a reef the same,&#x201D; Mydlarz said. &#x201C;Some coral are more susceptible to certain diseases. A reef is made up of many different species of coral. If a disease kills off one species of coral in a reef, that&#x2019;s going to greatly affect the reef community as a whole. We want to learn why some coral species are more tolerant of certain diseases.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/laura-mydlarz-2-022417.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>From left, Marilyn Brant, Laura Mydlarz and Erinn Muller are collaborating on the project. Photo courtesy of Laura Mydlarz.&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The project will focus on coral reefs in the Caribbean off the U.S. Virgin Islands. The site was chosen due to the high diversity of coral found there and the presence of &#x201C;white plague&#x201D; disease, which can cause rapid tissue loss in corals, affects many coral species and can cause partial or total colony mortality.</p>\n<p>The project will use immune-challenge experiments that will quantify novel components of the innate immune system of corals, coupled with the application of a trait-based model, to fulfill three goals, Mydlarz said.</p>\n<p>The first is to determine variability of coral immune traits in seven common coral species found on Caribbean reefs; the second is to determine the variability in resistance to white plague disease transmission in the same coral species; and the third is to develop a predictive model of coral community assemblage that incorporates immune traits.</p>\n<p>The coral species which will be examined differ in disease susceptibility, growth rates and reproductive strategies. Susceptibility to white plague disease will be measured by exposing the corals to active white plague and calculating disease transmission rates in a laboratory setting. The immune responses of each species will be measured by exposing samples to bacterial immune stimulators. Samples will be collected and injected with lipopolysaccharides, which are molecules that elicit strong immune responses in some organisms.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We want to see the coral in its natural state and in an immune-stimulated state,&#x201D; Mydlarz said.</p>\n<p>The immune response and disease transmission data for each coral species will be used to develop a predictive model to determine how different coral communities will respond to disease threats under climate change scenarios, she said.</p>\n<p>Mydlarz traveled to the Virgin Islands in October to visit the site where the research will be done and to meet with Brandt. She plans to return in June along with some of the graduate students from her laboratory to collect samples and conduct experiments.</p>\n<p>Clay Clark, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Biology, said the project is an example of the important work Mydlarz is doing to shed more light on the ties between climate change and the delicate ecosystems which have been adversely affected by that change. He noted that her research is a prime example of global environmental impact, which is one of the four pillars of the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020 Bold Solutions|Global Impact.</a></p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Mydlarz has been studying how environmental changes are affecting the ability of coral to fight disease for years and has contributed a great deal to our knowledge of coral immunity,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;This research will add to that knowledge and help us to better inform and encourage conservation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The research will be highlighted at outreach events in Texas, Florida and the Virgin Islands, including Earth Day Texas 2017, scheduled for April 22 at Fair Park in Dallas; the Living Reef Exhibit and Aquarium at Mote Marine Laboratory; and Reef Fest and agricultural fairs at Coral World Ocean Park in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p>Mydlarz earned bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s of science degrees in Marine Biology from Florida Atlantic University in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and received her doctorate in Marine Science from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2004.

Their work, <a href=\"https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2019/03/15/gr.240952.118.abstract\">&#x201C;The origins and evolution of chromosomes, dosage compensation, and mechanisms underlying venom regulation in snakes,&#x201D;</a> is published in the April issue of <i>Genome Research</i>, the scientific journal published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.</p>\n<p>UTA co-authors include Drew Schield, Daren Card, Nicole Hales, Blair Perry, Giulia Pasquesi, Richard Adams, and Andrew Corbin, all current or former members of Castoe&#x2019;s lab; doctoral student Balan Ramesh; biology Professor Esther Betr&#xE1;n; and biology Associate Professor Jeffery Demuth. Other co-authors include UTA doctoral graduates Heath Blackmon, Texas A&amp;M University, and Jesse Meik, Tarleton State University.</p>\n<p>The team analyzed the rattlesnake genome to investigate diverse features of vertebrate and snake biology, including the evolution of genome structure, how some chromosomes became sex chromosomes during snake evolution, and how multiple layers of genome organization drive the precise regulation of venom.</p>\n<p>The paper provides the first chromosome-level assembly of a reptile genome, and provides new evidence that microchromosomes present in some vertebrates may functionally interact in the nucleus in unique and previously unknown ways.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Despite extensive research on snake venom, very little is known about the genomic basis of this extreme adaptation and how venom has evolved over time,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;While venom is of major interest among snake biologists, the regions of snake genomes that harbor the genes to make venom have been among the most challenging regions of the genome to sequence and assemble accurately.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>By leveraging cutting-edge genome sequencing methods, the team was for the first time able to generate well-assembled snake venom genes. This provided new genomic context for how venom genes have evolved through a process called tandem duplication, leading to discrete clusters of venom genes in the genomic landscape. They also discovered that many venom genes are found on microchromosomes, which are densely packed with genes and have other distinctive features.</p>\n<p>The team also demonstrated that microchromosomes, which are absent in mammals but present in birds and many reptiles, have fundamentally distinct structure and function &#x2013; providing evidence that the genomes of many vertebrates do not necessarily &#x201C;work the same&#x201D; as the genomes of mammals.</p>\n<p>Researchers addressed how snakes are able to secrete venom via the regulation of venom genes exclusively in the venom gland, and not in other organs. They leveraged new cutting-edge sequencing approaches, called Hi-C sequencing, which captures information about interactions between different genomic regions in the nucleus, to analyze how genome organization directs this precise regulation of venom genes.</p>\n<p>They found that venom gene regions are isolated within distinct chromosomal structures called TADs, or topologically associating domains, in venom-secreting cells. These TADs form loops in the genomic DNA to localize the gene regulation machinery specifically to the genes for making venom, leading to a highly precise pattern of gene expression only in the venom gland. This finding provides evidence of a previously unknown mechanism regulating snake venom secretion, and exciting links between genome structure and function.</p>\n<p>While humans and other mammals have X and Y sex chromosomes, the rattlesnake has Z and W sex chromosomes. In ZW systems, males have two Z chromosomes and females have one Z and one W chromosome. Rattlesnake sex chromosomes are highly differentiated and exhibit many distinct characteristics compared to non-sex chromosomes, called autosomes. Highly differentiated sex chromosomes often require mechanisms to equalize gene expression between genetic sexes to ensure proper genome function &#x2013; these are called dosage compensation mechanisms.</p>\n<p>Snakes are especially intriguing because, instead of evolving a mechanism to equalize gene expression across the whole chromosome, as humans do, they have evolved dosage compensation in particular regions and possibly even specific genes on the Z chromosome.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;One of the most exciting features of the rattlesnake genome assembly is that it includes the first complete sex chromosome for a snake,&#x201D; said Schield, lead author on the paper.</p>\n<p>The researchers used the rattlesnake genome to trace the evolution of snake sex chromosomes, and the origins of sex-specific patterns of gene expression on the Z chromosome. They also identified the first genetic mechanism that may underlie snake dosage compensation. These findings establish new genomic context for the evolution of sex determination in snakes and provide new insight into the diversity of sex determination systems in vertebrates.</p>\n<p>Broadly, the findings of the paper focused on the rattlesnake genome highlight the tremendous biological value of quality genome resources for non-model species. The Castoe lab published the very first snake genome &#x2013; the Burmese python genome &#x2013; six years ago, and since then several other snake genome resources have become available. Each snake genome has enabled new discoveries about snake and vertebrate biology.</p>\n<p>With the rattlesnake genome, the caliber of snake genomes is now at the level of quality of many traditional model organisms. Having a diverse array of vertebrate genomes enables broad comparisons to understand fundamental aspects of genome biology. The rattlesnake genome adds to the growing list of species to allow for these comparisons, and also provides unprecedented potential to understand the unique features of snakes.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Castoe and his colleagues have made an important advance in our knowledge of the snake genome at the chromosome level,&#x201D; said Clay Clark, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Biology. &#x201C;Their findings about the genomic basis of venom evolution and snake sex chromosomes are exciting breakthroughs in snake genome research and confirms the Castoe lab&#x2019;s standing as one of the nation&#x2019;s leaders in snake genome research.&#x201D;</p>\n"

The program has earned a national reputation for its excellence and affordability. Most recently, Valuecolleges.com ranked it the sixth best registered nurse-to-bachelor of science in nursing program in the country.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The program is good. The instructors are amazing. And the college listens to student feedback,&#x201D; said Minaz Dungor, a May 2015 graduate of the program who said she was attracted to the program because of its flexibility and UTA&#x2019;s reputation as a respected public university.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Listening to feedback makes students feel like their voice is heard,&#x201D; added Dungor, who returned to UTA and graduated with a master&#x2019;s of science in nursing degree in December 2018.</p>\n<p>The RN-to-BSN program&#x2019;s creation was spurred largely by the 80 percent BSN by 2020 Initiative. The goal of the initiative is to ensure that 80 percent of the nation&#x2019;s registered nurses have bachelor&#x2019;s degrees by 2020. Several studies have shown an increase in patient care at hospitals with a higher percentage of nurses with BSN degrees.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA was very forward thinking and was a frontrunner among nursing schools in developing a first-rate online nursing program,&#x201D; said Pamela White, a UTA accelerated online program manager and a clinical assistant professor of nursing.</p>\n<p>Prior to launching the program, UTA officials worked diligently to determine and integrate best practices in online education.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These included the use of discussion boards to accelerate student engagement and a feeling of community, using small group sizes and short video clips to enhance materials,&#x201D; White said.&#xA0; &#x201C;Instead of having students listen to three-hour lectures, we included short video clips to stimulate students&#x2019; critical thinking.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Encouraged by the popularity of the program, college officials moved to expand most of their graduate nursing degrees online, making an advanced nursing education more accessible to students throughout the state and around the country. As a result of these online offerings, the college&#x2019;s enrollment has increased in recent years, exceeding 20,000. Two-thirds of these students take classes online, which offer the same education as attending in a classroom.</p>\n<p>The program has become more flexible and accessible over the years, making it easier for students to graduate on time, White said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Initially not every course was offered every time online,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Now the courses are offered on a consistent basis every six weeks, which makes it easier for students who want to complete it within a certain time frame or take two courses at a time.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The college will host a celebration of the program at 4 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 7 at the E.H. Hereford University Center, 300 W. First St.&#xA0; Call 817-272-7085 or email <a href=\"mailto:Phyllis.miller@uta.edu\">Phyllis.miller@uta.edu</a> for more information about the anniversary celebration.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">--&#xA0;&#xA0;<i>Written by Lekan Oguntoyinbo</i></p>\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Work is submitted anonymously, and a jury selects a winner. The\nwinning work is published through Editorial Cultura, a Guatemalan publisher. Fondo\nde Cultura Econ&#xF3;mica, which distributes books throughout Mexico, Central\nAmerica and the Caribbean, is also a contest sponsor. </p>\n<p>Ruiz-P&#xE9;rez said the award is particularly surprising\nbecause <i>&#x201C;Notas manuscripts llenas de\ninc&#xF3;gnitas&#x201D;</i> is a compilation of &#x201C;B-sides&#x201D; of his work: poems and fragments\nhe decided not to include in a different book he is writing and in another that\nis due later this year. The format and numerous topics formed a unique product,\nhe said, one with a particular unity coming from its fragmented condition.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>In a section of the book titled Revelations, he writes:</p>\n<p>&#x201C;God has come and did not tell me his\nname/ but I knew that it was he who went down to illuminate/ the darkness of my\nroom.</p>\n<p>God\ntold me anything and everything you said in my ear/ I heard nothing but He\nspoke softly and said yes/ nonexistent and leaves of the poplars shivered in\nthe night.</p>\n<p>Then\nGod revealed to me the secrets of the clouds, the murmur of rivers/ vocal\nsources and passages of old houses/ inhabited dwarf angels.&quot;</p>\n<p>Ruiz-P&#xE9;rez said the book is conceived from readings, reflections\non literature, life and existence, in general. </p>\n<p>In addition to his scholarly work in the field of Mexican literature,\nRuiz-P&#xE9;rez is a critically acclaimed poet in Mexico. There, he has won numerous\nnational and regional poetry prizes, such as the Jos&#xE9; Gorostiza Poetry Prize\n(2004), the Rodulfo Figueroa Regional Poetry Prize (2005), the Salvador\nGallardo D&#xE1;valos National Prize for Young Poets (2006). Such prizes have helped\nhim publish three books of poetry in Mexico, with two more to be published by the\nInstituto Mexiquense de Cultura (Mexico) later this year. </p>\n<p>The Ninth Annual Luis Cardoza y Arag&#xF3;n Poetry Prize will be\nofficially awarded during a Jan. 30 ceremony at the Mexican Embassy in\nGuatemala. </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About UT\nArlington</span></p>\n<p>The\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution and\nthe second largest institution in The University of Texas System.

The desks\ncould be raised and lowered with the push of a button, and the employees could\nchoose to sit, stand or walk at their discretion.&#xA0; The employees were surveyed for 52 weeks, and\nwore an accelerometer that kept track of their daily calories burned.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>When\nthe employees had the treadmill workstation, they burned an average of 74 more\ncalories per day than they did before they received the treadmill workstation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;What&#x2019;s\ngreat about that is that employees who had the treadmill workstations became\nmore productive in addition to becoming more active,&#x201D; Hamann said. &#x201C;Walking on\nthe treadmill didn&#x2019;t come at the expense of being a productive worker.

For fiscal year 2014, the total appropriation for the federal HSI Program is more than $100 million.</p>\n<p>Such grants may be used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement of academic offerings, program quality and institutional stability, all of which benefit the entire student population.</li>\n<li>Mentorship programs to enhance retention and graduation rates of first-generation college students.</li>\n<li>Recruitment of Hispanic students in STEM fields.</li>\n<li>Identification and recruitment of high-performance students from high school and community colleges to create a pipeline to UT Arlington.</li>\n<li>Internship opportunities.</li>\n<li>Recruitment of new international students.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>David Silva, UT Arlington vice provost for faculty affairs, guided the application process and said that the status means that the funds are applicable to their work and research needs, too.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In addition to investing in our students, the HSI designation will provide new opportunities for faculty recruitment, faculty development and early-career scholars, and for strengthening UT Arlington&#x2019;s community partnerships,&#x201D; Silva said.</p>\n<p>Robert Estrada, a UT Arlington Development Board member and chairman of Dallas-based Estrada Hinojosa &amp; Co., applauded the new designation and called it &#x201C;a critical step toward providing greater resources and opportunities for all students, including the Hispanic population.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a clear reflection of the changing demographics of the North Texas region, and I am proud to see UT Arlington pursuing available resources to serve its diverse study population,&#x201D; Estrada said. &#x201C;Diversity is part of what makes UT Arlington the world-class institution that it is, and its students and faculty are worthy of additional federal support.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Antonio Flores, president of the National Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, has said that educating Latinos is crucial to future U.S. economic stability and growth. Latinos are projected to make up a majority of the Texas population by 2020 and nearly 30 percent of the nation&#x2019;s population by 2050.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We need them to be more educated and more qualified than past generations so that we can sustain the rest of the economy and have the workforce needed to maintain our competitiveness in a global economy,&#x201D; said Flores, who spoke at UT Arlington April 16 as part of the Center for Mexican American Studies Speaker Series. &quot;We need to invest in the education and training of Latinos from the ground up, from kindergarten to 12th grade, into college and beyond.&quot;</p>\n<p>Universities must re-apply for the Hispanic-Serving Institution designation annually.

William Becker, TCU assistant professor of management, and Wendy Boswell, management professor at Texas A&amp;M University, joined Butts in the study titled, &#x201C;Hot Buttons and Time Sinks: The Effects of Electronic Communication during Nonwork Time on Emotions and Work-Nonwork Conflict.&quot;</p>\n<p>The researchers surveyed 341 working adults during a seven-day period to track their feelings when they opened a work email away from the office. The three authors used Facebook, Linked In and Twitter contacts to build their sample pool.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;People who were part of the study reported they became angry when they received a work email or text after they had gone home and that communication was negatively worded or required a lot of the person&#x2019;s time,&#x201D; Butts said. &#x201C;Also, the people who tried to separate work from their personal life experienced more work-life interference. The after-hours emails really affected those workers&#x2019; personal lives.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Overall, Butts said two major categories of workers were identified: the segmentors and the integrators.</p>\n<p>He said the segmentors wanted to keep their personal and work lives separate. Not surprisingly, that was the category of participant who was most negatively impacted when facing after business hours communications.</p>\n<p>Butts said the integrators were the participants who wanted to know what was going on at work when they received an email or text. They got angry as well when receiving communications but it didn&#x2019;t interfere with their personal lives.</p>\n<p>Rachel Croson, dean of the College of Business, said Butts&#x2019; study is important because electronic communications have become a fabric of everyone&#x2019;s life.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Smartphones and the accompanying culture of &#x2018;always on&#x2019; has made after-hours communication ubiquitous,&#x201D; Croson said. &#x201C;But, like everything else in business, it can be done well or badly, and implementation is critical for success. This study informs leaders not just whether and when, but also how to communicate with employees.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Some of the recommendations the study makes include training for what to say and what not to say in an email or text, setting boundaries for when to send electronic correspondence, guidelines for proper communication style and topics best discussed face-to-face rather than electronically.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is the new world of work communication, and these recommendations might work in one department of a company but not in another area of the business,&#x201D; Butts said. &#x201C;The key is to develop your own appropriate communications rhythm within your department.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Butts said one of the most surprising findings of the study was that people who received positive electronic communications after hours were happy. However, those &#x201C;good vibes&#x201D; weren&#x2019;t long lasting, Butts said.</p>\n<p>Butts said his wife, Erin, initially got him interested in the subject of electronic communications from work after hours. She works for a company that at times uses after-hours emails and texts.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I just saw how her after hours communications often impacted our personal life for better or worse, and thought maybe other people have similar experiences,&#x201D; Butts said.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution of nearly 48,000 students around the world and the second largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Existing electrode based ACC stimulation lacks specificity and leads to activation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our results clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that optogenetic stimulation of inhibitory neurons in ACC leads to decreased neuronal activity and a dramatic reduction of pain behavior,&#x201D; Mohanty said. &#x201C;Moreover, we confirmed optical modulation of specific electrophysiological responses from different neuronal units in the thalamus part of the brain, in response to particular types of pain-stimuli.&#x201D; &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The research focused on chemical irritants and mechanical pain, such as that experienced following a pinprick or pinch. Mohanty said the results could lead to increased understanding of pain pathways and strategies for managing chronic pain, which often leads to severe impairment of normal psychological and physical functions.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;While reducing the sensation for chronic pain by optical stimulation, we still want to sense certain types of pain because they tell us to move our hands or legs away from something that is too hot or that might otherwise hurt us if we get too close,&#x201D; Mohanty said.</p>\n<p>Young-tae Kim, a UT Arlington associate professor of bioengineering and study co-author, said the research could &#x201C;possibly lead to less invasive methods for treating more severe types of pain without losing important emotional, sensing and behavioral functions.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Ling Gu, a postdoctoral researcher who worked in the Mohanty lab, is lead author on the PLOS ONE paper, &#x201C;Pain inhibition by Optogenetic Activation of Specific Anterior Cingulate Cortical Neurons.&#x201D; Other co-authors are Megan Uhelski, previous UT Arlington doctoral student in psychology, and Sanjay Anand, researchers in bioengineering; Mario Romero-Ortega, an associate professor of bioengineering at UT Dallas; and, Perry Fuchs, UT Arlington professor of psychology.

Students, faculty or staff may join the membership program for $25, then pay $7.50 per hour or $69 a day to reserve one of four vehicles parked on campus.</p>\n<p>The cost includes gas, insurance, 24-hour roadside assistance, wireless technology, and other features. Visit <a href=\"http://www.zipcar.com/uta\">www.zipcar.com/uta</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is an innovative and cost-effective form of transportation that will help the entire UT Arlington community,&#x201D; said Meghna Tare, director of the UT Arlington <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/sustainability/\">Office of Sustainability</a>. &#x201C;Based on our research, Zipcar will prove especially beneficial for our growing international population.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Total University enrollment surpassed 40,000 students this year. A significant number are international students living on or near the Arlington campus. In spring 2014, 1,289 students from India alone were enrolled at UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Many of our international students come to Texas with no means of transportation. In addition to reducing the number of vehicles on campus and need for parking spaces, Zipcar will provide the students with a convenient option for getting to the grocery store, a doctor&#x2019;s appointment, or to meet research and study needs that carry them across the state,&#x201D; Tare said. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The new Zipcar program will initially offer four vehicles: a Ford Escape and Focus, Nissan Versa and Volkswagen Golf. The vehicles will be parked in two locations: in the Meadow Run Apartments parking lot behind the Swift Center, and in Lot 39, just south of the UTA Bookstore. See the campus map at <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/maps/\">www.uta.edu/maps/</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"ColorfulList-Accent11\">&#x201C;By bringing Zipcar to UT Arlington, the school is offering a convenient alternative to bringing a car to campus,&#x201D; said Katelyn Lopresti, general manager of Zipcar University. &#x201C;The Zipcar program will give students, as well as faculty and staff, the freedom of having a car without the expense or hassles.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Zipcar said, on average, when car owners switch to car sharing, the number miles driven per member is reduced by 50 percent. The company said its &#x201C;Zipsters&#x201D; save over $500 a month and members of Zipcar and other car-sharing programs report a 47 percent increase in public transit trips, a 10 percent increase in bicycling trips, and a 26 percent increase in walking trips.</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/sustainability\">www.uta.edu/sustainability</a> or call 817-272-9299 for information about other sustainable programs offered at UT Arlington.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About Zipcar</span></strong></p>\n<p>Zipcar, the world&apos;s leading car sharing network, has operations in urban areas and college campuses throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain and Austria.

        "body": "\n<p class=\"Default\">Two\nUT Arlington management professors argue that employers can prevent workplace\nviolence by keeping dangerous employees positively engaged and closely\nsupervising them to ensure they get the help they need.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption300\"><img alt=\"M. Ann McFadyen and Jim Quick\" src=\"/news/images/quick-mcfadyen.jpeg\" width=\"300\"><figcaption>M. Ann McFadyen and James Campbell Quick.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p class=\"Default\">James\nCampbell Quick and M. Ann McFadyen of the College of Business management\ndepartment analyzed FBI reports, case studies and human resource records to\nfocus on the estimated 1 to 3 percent of employees prone to workplace acts of\naggression, such as homicide, suicide or destruction of property.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The\nteam advances the case for &#x201C;mindfully observing&#x201D; employees and found that human\nresources professionals and supervisors can advance health, wellbeing, and\nperformance while averting danger and violence by identifying and managing\nhigh-risk employees, anticipating their needs and providing support and\nresources.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The cause of these problems are\nunderstandable and predictable,&#x201D; said Quick, a Distinguished Professor of\nLeadership and Organizational Behavior. &#x201C;And many times these violent incidents\nshouldn&#x2019;t be viewed as random or surprises.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The paper, <a href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=2051-6614&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=1&amp;articleid=17107581&amp;show=html\">&#x201C;No\nAccident: Health, Wellbeing, Performance &#x2026; and Danger,&#x201D;</a> is\npublished by the <i>Journal of\nOrganizational Effectiveness: People and Performance. </i>The two teamed with\nOklahoma State University&#x2019;s Debra Nelson on the study. Nelson is the Spears\nSchool of Business Associates&#x2019; Chaired Professor of Business Administration and\nDistinguished Professor of Management. She also was the 2004 Goolsby\nDistinguished Visiting Professor.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Corporations need to plug troubled employees\ninto the social network immediately so they don&#x2019;t store up these negative\nfeelings whenever and wherever they get them,&#x201D; said Quick, who also holds the John and Judy Goolsby-Jacqualyn A. Fouse\nEndowed Chair&#xA0;in the Goolsby Leadership Academy. Quick also is a distinguished\nvisiting scholar at Lancaster University Management School in the United\nKingdom.</p>\n<p>College of Business Dean Rachel Croson\nsaid this type of research adds insight for businesses in the real world.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Businesses often look at these problems\nonly after they occur,&#x201D; Croson said. &#x201C;This research offers companies action\nsteps they can take to prevent such tragedies from occurring. It not only helps\npeople but could save lives.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>McFadyen&#x2019;s role in the research was\nlooking at positive and negative deviant behaviors among employees. Positive\ndeviant acts will often benefit the organization (i.e. going out of one&#x2019;s way\nto help another). Conversely, negative deviant acts will likely have an adverse\nimpact on the organization and have the potential to put the organization or\nothers in danger. </p>\n<p>The study noted that the low intense\nnegative deviant act of incivility is often the starting point of the\nescalation to more dangerous and violent behavior. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Incivility toward another includes\ngossiping, texting in meetings, withholding information, ignoring or simply a\ngeneral lack of respect or regard for others,&#x201D; McFadyen said. &#x201C;What is\nconcerning is that incivility is on the rise in the workplace, with the\nmajority of employees reporting that they have been the target of incivility by\nanother.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Research indicates that most\norganizations have training on ethics and diversity, yet few provide training\non incivility. </p>\n<p>McFadyen said the study gives guidance\non how to train supervisors to recognize and monitor incivility.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Incivility, left unchecked, may lead to\nmore dangerous acts&#x201D;, McFadyen said. &#x201C;Research indicates that, while not all\nacts of incivility lead to violent acts, all violent acts in the workplace were\npreceded by acts of incivility.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>One challenge, Quick said, is that\nemployees often cannot be pre-screened for these tendencies. He said dangerous\nemployees don&#x2019;t often show the inclination for dangerous behavior during the\ninterview process.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s often something that those\nemployees get once they&#x2019;re in a job,&#x201D; Quick said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why socialization and\nmaking sure employees air out what&#x2019;s bothering them are two big factors in\nwhether the behavior eventually becomes an incident.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Quick said it&#x2019;s imperative for\norganizations to keep the employees talking about what it is that&#x2019;s bothering\nthem.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t allow the dangerous employee\nto bury the issue,&#x201D; Quick said. &#x201C;And sometimes organizations have a problem in\nwanting to see the issue come to the surface. Organizations have to admit they\nbe part of the problem.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Quick and the team take actual cases\nwhere dangerous employees took action that ended in a wrongful death, sexual\nassault and management harassment. The team also looked at one positive organizational\ncase where harm and death were averted.</p>\n<p>In addition, the study also shows what\norganizations and people need to do to right themselves after dangerous\nemployees&#x2019; behavior leads to a violent incident.</p>\n<p>Quick said the study outlines a\nfour-step approach if the worse should happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contain the perpetrator or problem.</li>\n<li>Provide physical and mental caregiving for\nvictims of the incident.</li>\n<li>Encourage forgiveness of the dangerous employee.\nForgiveness is not condoning, excusing, denying, minimizing or forgetting a\nwrong.</li>\n<li>Learning from the dangerous employee&#x2019;s incident.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is\na comprehensive research institution and the second largest institution in The\nUniversity of Texas System.&#xA0;<i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>&#xA0;ranked\nUT Arlington as the seventh fastest-growing public research university in\n2013.&#xA0;<i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>&#xA0;ranks UT Arlington fifth in\nthe nation for undergraduate diversity.

        "body": "\n<p>UT Arlington and Texas Health Arlington Memorial Hospital are investigating whether bone grown from the body&#x2019;s own stem cells can replace traditional types of bone grafting.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption250\"><img alt=\"Drs. Tang and Borrelli\" src=\"/news/images/tang-borrelli.jpeg\" width=\"250\"><figcaption>Dr. Liping Tang, left, bioengineering chair and professor, and Dr. Joseph Borrelli,&#xA0;chair of orthopedics for Texas Health Arlington Memorial, are lead investigators of the research project studying whether bone tissue can be created from a patient&apos;s own stem cells.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The process, which has been successful in previous lab experiments, uses biodegradable polymer scaffolding material and bone morphogenetic protein, or BMP, which was inserted into the abdomen of mice to attract stem cells that in turn produced bone. BMPs are proteins known to promote bone growth. The research is detailed in a new paper, &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0093514\"><i>Tissue Engineering Bone Using Autologous Progenitor Cells in the Peritoneum</i>,</a>&#x201D; published by the online journal PLoS One.</p>\n<p>Liping Tang, UT Arlington bioengineering chair and professor, and Dr. Joseph Borrelli, chair of orthopedics for Texas Health Arlington Memorial, co-authored the paper and are lead investigators of the research project.</p>\n<p>Tang said the process will allow surgeons to establish a &#x201C;mini-bioreactor&#x201D; in a patient&#x2019;s own body. Scientists determined that the abdomen of a mouse effectively mimics the traumatic and foreign body environmental response that takes place during various bone repair procedures in humans. Bone tissue can be generated in a few days through the process, he said, rather than the weeks or months existing processes take in a lab setting.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This research will help us to formalize a specific type of scaffolding mixture that could eliminate the use of current bone grafting techniques,&#x201D; Borrelli said.</p>\n<p>The procedure could help with open bone fractures, osteomyelitis, fractures that fail to heal, congenital malformations, tumors and, in a more general sense, perhaps osteoporosis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to use the body&#x2019;s own healing capacity in bone repair, Borrelli said. For instance, today if a patient suffers from a bone defect or complex tibia fracture, a surgeon may perform an iliac crest bone graft, taking bone from the pelvis.</p>\n<p>During the bone graft procedure, the surgeon uses a mechanism that scrapes or shaves bone from the pelvis. The bone shavings are then placed directly into the defect or combined with other proteins. If successful, the research involving Borrelli and Tang will eliminate the grafting technique altogether.</p>\n<p>Borrelli said the current grafting procedure has a 25 percent complication rate. He said the new procedure will help curtail the complication rate associated with bone grafting and reduce medical costs.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In the future, a physician will be able to inject the scaffolding material with the ideal protein into the area where the patient&#x2019;s bone needs to grow or repair, and the patient&#x2019;s cells will never have to leave the body,&#x201D; Borelli said. &#x201C;It will cut down on cost. It will cut down on surgery time. It will enhance patient comfort, too.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the UT Arlington College of Engineering, said the collaboration between the hospital and the university is the kind of collaboration that can lead to innovation in health care.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Partners like Texas Health Arlington Memorial keep our researchers focused on goals that will help people,&#x201D; Behbehani said. &#x201C;The work by Dr. Tang and Dr. Borrelli holds the promise of a medical advancement that can save patients time and money and improve treatment.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The research team said the process could become an outpatient procedure in the future.</p>\n<p>Texas Health Arlington Memorial is funding $90,000 to support further research on this and other clinically relevant projects. This money will also pay for a doctoral student in Tang&#x2019;s lab.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We couldn&#x2019;t think of a better collaborative project to be a part of,&#x201D; said Kirk King, Texas Health Arlington Memorial president. &#x201C;By working with talented individuals at UT Arlington, we&#x2019;re helping advance science with the ultimate goal of enhancing health care to improve an individual&#x2019;s quality of life.

And while this may be true, those survivors with debilitating, lingering effects of cancer and its treatment are not always acknowledged within healthcare systems as needing continued care based on their cancer survivor status,&#x201D; said Gail Adorno, assistant professor in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/ssw/\">UT Arlington School of Social Work</a> and co-principal investigator on the study.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our findings suggest that cancer survivors do experience a variety of unmet needs from having had cancer and/or its treatment,&#x201D; Adorno said.</p>\n<p>To gauge the unmet needs of cancer survivors, researchers assessed responses from an <a href=\"http://www.cancer.org/index?_ga=1.215869783.1784982967.1425397503\">American Cancer Society</a> survey of 1,514 participants, age 18 years or older. The participants were randomly selected from population-based cancer registries in 14 different states and survivors of breast, prostate, colorectal, skin melanoma, bladder, or uterine cancer. They responded to the open-ended question: Please tell us about any needs you have now as a cancer survivor that are not being met to your satisfaction.</p>\n<p>A six-person interdisciplinary team spent more than 200 hours analyzing the answers, coding them into 16 themes of responses. The themes ranged from financial unmet needs to personal control, including the inability to control urine and lack of sexual function.</p>\n<p>Mary Ann Burg, professor of social work at the <a href=\"http://www.ucf.edu/\">University of Central Florida</a> and co-principal investigator, noted that improvements are needed concerning public awareness of cancer survivors&#x2019; problems, honest professional communication about the side effects of cancer, and the coordination of medical care resources to help survivors and their families cope with their lingering challenges.</p>\n<p>The average number of unmet needs per survivor was 2.88, with breast cancer survivors identifying more unmet needs than other survivors in the study. Survivors most frequently expressed physical problems, with 38 percent saying they were an issue.</p>\n<p>Personal control -- such as the ability to plan and make decisions with regard to one&#x2019;s own health care, talking about one&#x2019;s cancer to employers or others, or the ability to move as desired -- was one of the dominant themes in the responses, having not been previously identified in the literature on unmet needs.</p>\n<p>The average number of needs declined with age, but did not differ consequentially by gender. However, significantly more men than women identified with the themes of physical needs and personal control needs.</p>\n<p>Additional investigators on the study include: Cara Wallace from The University of Texas at Arlington; Ellen D.S.

It could be as big as a subway with tracks or it could be as small as a tube dependent on what is being transported. The new trenchless technologies with minimum surface disturbance will be utilized for the tube construction.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Najafi is a nationally known expert on underground infrastructure construction and maintenance, critical to urban living and sustainability,&#x201D; said Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/about/\">College of Engineering</a>. &#x201C;The proposed project is an innovative application of his expertise and techniques that he has developed to address a real need of transporting goods in urban settings efficiently and in an environmentally sound way.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The United States hasn&#x2019;t completely embraced the underground freight technology and system, Najafi said. He cited examples in Europe and China, where such systems are being researched.</p>\n<p>Najafi said this project would be done in three phases over three years. Researchers will conduct an initial feasibility study first. In the second phase, researchers will build a garage-sized, small-scale test model at the CURIE facility in the Civil Engineering Lab Building. The final phase may include a two- to three-mile stretch of underground freight tunnel in downtown Houston or the border area in Laredo due to heavy traffic freight in these areas.</p>\n<p>The TxDOT project is titled &#x201C;Integrating Underground Freight Transportation into Existing Intermodal Systems,&#x201D; which suggests that existing right-of-way would be used along Texas interstate highways and roads, Najafi said.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About UT Arlington </span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution of more than 49,000 students around the world and the second largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Currently, no pressure gain combustion engines exist on the market.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Up to 70 percent of energy is lost in current gas turbine combustion engine technology just because that technology hasn&#x2019;t changed in several decades,&#x201D; Bello said. &#x201C;We capture the bulk of that energy more efficiently so that it&#x2019;s not wasted as heat in the body of the engine.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Afthon&#x2019;s technology burns fuel more than 30 times faster than an original gas engine. The technology uses the same amount of fuel but releases the energy very quickly so that it does the work faster.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It allows us to rev the engine down,&#x201D; Bello said. &#x201C;We can decrease the power to 10 percent of the generator&#x2019;s capacity without sacrificing speed and maintaining efficiency.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Another marketable aspect of the process is that it can use many types of fuel, including natural gas, propane, kerosene or diesel.</p>\n<p>Thanks to funding from VentureWell, Afthon has developed a lab prototype, and hopes to soon build a field prototype generator, upon raising seed capital. Bello believes technical development could happen in two to three years, understanding that it usually takes technology companies five to seven years to finish this stage.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution of more than 49,000 students around the world and the second largest institution in The University of Texas System.

In optofluidic lasers, two-phase liquids are controlled using microfluidics and nanofluidics to form a highly efficient optical microcavity. The all-liquid nature makes the laser adaptive and achieves high-precision tuning in an unprecedented manner.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Optofluidic lasers are unique because the microlaser can be achieved through &#x2018;smart&#x2019; self-assembly at the liquid-liquid interface,&#x201D; Sun said. &#x201C;Because of this unique structure, the optofluidic laser is biocompatible and bioconfigurable. It could eventually be applied to in-vivo biosensing, although this is beyond the scope of the current project.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Sun said she initially will explore using the optofluidic laser to detect biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and possibly other genetic disorders at the molecular and cellular level.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This could someday lead to the creation of a point-of-care platform for clinicians to use in an office, rather than having to send samples away for analysis,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p>Sun&#x2019;s CAREER Award is a personal feather in her cap, but also reflects a greater commitment to innovative, transformative research at UTA, said Duane Dimos, the University&#x2019;s vice president for research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Sun&#x2019;s CAREER Award represents the NSF&#x2019;s stamp of approval of her status as a rising star in her field. Her work shows the sophistication of a seasoned researcher and is a stellar example of UTA&#x2019;s impact on health and the human condition,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;The University also is committed to making technological advancements that help people live longer, healthier and happier lives, and her research exemplifies this commitment.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Sun&#x2019;s work is representative of how UTA is advancing research in the area of <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a> under the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.

The problem is especially acute among minority children, particularly Hispanics and blacks, whose obesity rates hover at about 22 percent compared to 14 percent for white children.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/nursing-soccer-gpisd.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Children and their parents are participating in the pilot study at the Young Men&#x2019;s Leadership Academy in Grand Prairie.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/index.php\">College of Nursing and Health Innovation</a> is taking steps to address this obesity crisis. For the last several months, nursing and kinesiology faculty and students have been working on a pilot research study at Young Men&#x2019;s Leadership Academy, a predominantly Latino all-male middle school in the Grand Prairie Independent School District.</p>\n<p>The study uses two popular strategies to tackle obesity: nutrition literacy and exercise.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The nutrition component deals with reading labels, food portions, and explaining what&#x2019;s a carb, vitamin or fat,&#x201D; explained Dr. Margarita Trevino, an associate professor of clinical nursing and director of the college&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/conhi/research/chsnh/index.php\">Center for Hispanic Studies in Nursing and Health</a>. &#x201C;We teach them to understand if something has too much fat, salt or enough protein. It&#x2019;s very simple but it is fundamental to critical thinking skills that will translate into good health habits.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>David Espinosa, a UTA alumnus and Grand Prairie ISD board member, praised UTA&#x2019;s commitment to improving health and wellness among school age children.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Middle school is an ideal stage for teaching children about nutrition and health,&#x201D; Espinosa said. &#x201C;By learning these lessons at an early age they will develop habits that will enhance the length and quality of their lives. They will become more physically fit, develop a stronger self-image and perform better in the classroom.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Two senior nursing students, Megan Isaacs and Lisa Durham, played key roles in the development of the nutrition education classes for the students. Trevino said the pilot project is an outgrowth of a 2014 plan by a UTA think tank to do more to serve surrounding communities. Improving health and the human condition is one of the four main themes of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan | 2020</a>.</p>\n<p>Trevino said Grand Prairie was chosen to kick off the pilot project because of the pockets of low-income neighborhoods that dot some parts of the city and also because a preliminary examination showed that many of the children are pre-disposed to diabetes, hypertension and obesity.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/trevino-nelson.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Margarita Trevino, l, Larry Nelson, r, of the UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;We wanted to see if we could change health or lifestyle pattern by increasing levels of physical activity and health literacy,&#x201D; Trevino said. &#x201C;Soccer is very popular with students at the school, and so faculty members decided to use it to entice them to participate in the study.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Larry Nelson, an associate professor of kinesiology, said the team wants to measure how much physical activity the children are getting in soccer. He said they would like to put accelerometers on the boys to measure the amount of physical activity they&#x2019;re getting not only on the soccer field but also in every waking minute.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;What that does is give us a nice profile of how much physical activity they are getting at this age and how much the soccer program is contributing to that physical activity output,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;What we plan to do with this data is show that this is a really big health enhancing activity that we&#x2019;re delivering to this population.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nelson said he and his students are still in the data-gathering phase but they expect to find significant results.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;That helps us to go after funding and really try to expand the program into other junior high schools in the district and try to keep it going,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;This gives us proof that we are providing a lot of exercise to the kids and then we can secure funding to expand it.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Trevino said the long-term goal is to grow the program throughout the district. That, she added, could have significant ramifications in all spheres of the lives of these children. &#x201C;As children&#x2019;s health improves, grades improve and children are less likely to have high rate of absenteeism,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of more than 50,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Her research examines how organizations can support employees in balancing work with their personal lives and how that support relates to human resource outcomes such as recruitment and retention effectiveness.</p>\n<p>The Society recognized Casper&#x2019;s prolific research and many contributions to the field of organizational behavior. She will be formally inducted into the Society as a Fellow on April 13 during a ceremony at the annual conference of the Society in Anaheim, Calif.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Being named a SIOP Fellow is a tremendous honor, and signifies that my research program as a whole has made an outstanding contribution to the field,&#x201D; Casper said. &#x201C;Because this is an honor bestowed upon me by other Fellows in my field, it indicates that my scholarship has made an impact on the field and that I have earned the respect of my peers for my scholarly contributions. I am delighted and am very appreciative of my colleagues who nominated me for this honor.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.siop.org/default.aspx\">Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology</a> is the premier membership organization for those practicing and teaching industrial and organizational psychology, and is a self-governing division within the American Psychological Association.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Management Department Chair Abdul Rasheed said, &#x201C;Dr. Casper&#x2019;s work has sought to build an understanding of what people actually mean when they use the term &#x2018;work-life balance.&#x2019; She has found that people may think about how satisfied they are, how successful they are, and how involved they are in their roles when they use this term, but that people differ in terms of what makes them feel balanced. This is a new insight into our understanding of work-life balance.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Rachel Croson, dean of the College of Business, said Casper&#x2019;s honor is well-deserved recognition of her significant scholarly contributions.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Her contributions to the fields of organizational behavior and human resource management are impressive and nationally recognized. The impact of her research is significant as well, helping organizations to support a better-performing workforce through work-life balance,&#x201D; Croson said. &#x201C;Dr. Casper&#x2019;s innumerable contributions to the college have contributed to the success of our Ph.D. students and to our strong management curriculum. I&#x2019;m pleased and proud that she has been recognized with this highest honor in her field.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Casper has studied extensively a variety of work-life balance topics, including the impact on job attitudes, the function of gender roles in managing work-life issues, how policies that support work-life balance benefit organizations and employees, international perspectives and single employees in the workplace.</p>\n<p>She and her colleagues, including fellow management professor Marcus Butts, recently published a study of employees at an engineering consulting firm and found that supervisors rated employees who had greater balance as performing better at work than those who were less balanced.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This finding often surprises people, as we often assume that top performance requires total investment in work to the exclusion of all else, but the research does not support that assumption,&#x201D; Casper said.</p>\n<p>Casper&#x2019;s research has earned her numerous awards and research grants, among them a UTA Dean&#x2019;s Fellowship and a Society for Human Resource Management Grant for research on work-family policies co-published with Butts.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington </span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of more than 50,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

They were interested in helping others have a child because they enjoyed being pregnant. They saw it as something they were good at &#x2013; a skill set.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Cawthon, acting dean of the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/libarts/index.html\">College of Liberal Arts</a>, said Jacobson&#x2019;s research provides valuable insights about reproductive technology affecting Americans and changing how we think about maternity, family and the labor involved in giving birth.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Jacobson does a comprehensive job of dissecting the complex set of social attitudes underlying gestational surrogacy, its role in health and gender studies,&#x201D; Cawthon said. &#x201C;There are a lot of misconceptions about infertility, reproductive technologies and surrogacy that are reinforced in the media, popular television programs and movies; and, this work will help advance the larger conversation about these issues and help to correct misinformation.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Cawthon added that the research is representative of UTA&#x2019;s commitment to advancing health and the human condition as outlined in UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>In her studies, Jacobson found surrogates and others involved in surrogacy having to navigate basic misconceptions about the medical procedures involved and the motivations and experiences people have in surrogacy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption200\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/jacobson-book-cover.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The research is based on in-depth interviews conducted between 2009-2015 with surrogates that Jacobson connected with through surrogate agencies and various digital platforms. In addition to surrogates, she interviewed, their family members, the &#x201C;intended parents&#x201D; who employ surrogates, infertility doctors, directors of surrogacy agencies, family lawyers, and various other professionals who work to facilitate gestational surrogacy &#x2013; an advanced reproductive technology that allows women to be surrogates without contributing their own eggs.</p>\n<p>The surrogates in her study were between the ages of 25 and 45 at the time of the interviews, with the oldest surrogate having given birth to a &#x201C;surro-baby&#x201D; at the age of 41. All were paid, from $15,000 to $35,000. Most of the women were married, financially stable and all had children of their own. Most were Caucasian, but there were also Hispanic and African-American surrogates in the study. Jacobson noted that the majority of the surrogates in her study were not stay-at-home mothers, as often assumed, but worked outside of the home in what are called the &#x2018;caring professions&#x2019; -- such as nursing, teaching, social services or social work.</p>\n<p>Surrogacy itself is not federally regulated, so there is no federal data on the numbers of surrogacies in the United States, Jacobson said. According to the book, there are an estimated 1,500 surrogate births per year in the U.S. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I found it interesting that surrogates are reluctant to think of this as work because they engage in a tremendous amount of labor in helping to produce a child for people who desperately want one,&#x201D; Jacobson said. &#x201C;They re-arrange their lives and the lives of their families, and if the pregnancy goes well, it can be a year-long investment&#x2014;if there are complications, it can be a many year investment.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In the book, Jacobson investigates why not only surrogates, but the surrogacy industry, are reluctant to think about surrogacy as work.</p>\n<p>Jacobson joined the UTA Department of Sociology and Anthropology in 2006. She holds both a Ph.D. and Master&#x2019;s degree in Sociology from Brandeis University. She also has a Master&#x2019;s degree in Women&#x2019;s Studies from the University of Dublin, Trinity College. She earned bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in drama and history from Carnegie Mellon University.</p>\n<p>In her first book, &#x201C;Culture Keeping: White Mothers, International Adoption, and the Negotiation of Family Difference (Vanderbilt Press, 2008),&#x201D; she examined how conceptions of family and of race shape the ethnic practices of international adoptive families with children from China and Russia.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;<i>Labor of Love: Gestational Surrogacy and the Work of Making Babies</i>&#x201D; is available now at <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Labor-Love-Gestational-Surrogacy-Families/dp/0813569508/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458770411&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=LABOR+OF+LOVE+HEATHER+JACOBSON\">Amazon.com</a> and at the UTA Bookstore, 400 S.

Yuze &#x201C;Alice&#x201D; Sun, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at UTA, is co-principal investigator.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Big companies like IBM and Intel are using this technology for high-performance computing centers,&#x201D; Zhou said. &#x201C;The big push now is for the next big thing: smaller, faster, and less and less power consumption.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Zhou also has recently received a three-year, $935,000 grant from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research&#xA0;to&#xA0;explore extreme energy efficiency lasers, in collaboration with Professors Shanhui Fan at Stanford and Xiuling Li at&#xA0;the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</p>\n<p>The projects point to an increasingly important role The University of Texas at Arlington is playing in the world of lasers and how they work on semiconductors.</p>\n<p>Zhou is a Fellow of the International Society for Optical Engineering. He holds three issued patents related to this technology and has more than 270 journal publications and conference presentations.

It outlined Zhou&#x2019;s findings from related research supported by the National Science Foundation, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Army Research Office.</p>\n<p>His previous research led to innovations that removed roadblocks to putting optical technology on a silicon chip.</p>\n<p>Specifically, Zhou developed a membrane laser less than one micron thick that is compatible with planar Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon platforms, which are the building blocks for all electronics and can be easily integrated with current platforms. The key innovation is the integration of certain compound semiconductor material with a silicon photonic crystal cavity, which allows a laser to be built directly on a silicon chip next to other electrical components. This leads to higher speed and higher efficiency.</p>\n<p>The first application of Zhou&#x2019;s laser is in computers and data centers where higher bandwidth and transfer rates at lower energy outputs are prized. Zhou&#x2019;s group is actively pursuing various innovative membrane laser architectures for extreme energy efficient computing and communication systems. Zhou and collaborators will use his new grant to continue innovations in high-performance membrane lasers, including the one reported in <i>Nature Photonics</i> in 2012, entitled, &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v6/n9/full/nphoton.2012.160.html\">Transfer printing stacked nanomembrane lasers on silicon</a>.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are looking for devices and components to be integrated on a chip,&#x201D; Zhou said. &#x201C;As we address electrical injection, integration with other devices on the chip and increased power capabilities, we can begin to apply this technology to products in the medical field or in the consumer arena. These applications could include portable electronics, sensing and imaging equipment, bio applications and wearable electronics.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Zhou has been the primary investigator on research grants totaling nearly $6 million and has been involved with more than 30 projects totaling more than $18 million since 2004.</p>\n<p>The Electrical Engineering Department is an integral component of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering\">College of Engineering</a>, which recently became the third-largest in Texas with an enrollment of more than 7,000.

Eleven teams will share $100,000 in the inaugural round of awards.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Increasingly we are seeing that innovation on the part of engineers and computer scientists yields greater results when married with liberal arts and the humanities,&#x201D; said Paul Wong, dean of the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/libarts/index.html\">College of Liberal Arts</a>. &#x201C;The reality is that our economy and global environment demand creative and collaborative research such as the Border Land project co-led by Dr. Haynes. UTA is proud to nurture such an initiative that will bring about better understanding, in this case, of the state&#x2019;s distinctive history.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Wong added: &#x201C;We are pleased that our College of Liberal Arts Digital Arts and Humanities Initiative will make research globally available for scholars to analyze and extract information for their own investigations.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Throughout history, much of Americans&#x2019; understanding of the interaction between Native Americans and Euro-Americans has been largely anecdotal and impressionistic, researchers say. Haynes and Holmes said no attempt has been made to compile information on acts of violence among the many peoples of Texas between 1821-1846 &#x2013; and no effort has been made to create a digital map of them.</p>\n<p>Motives of revenge, deaths resulting from the seizure of livestock and captives, and defensive attacks against surveying parties were all part of the matrix of violence that framed relations during this period, Haynes said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/quanah-exhibit.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>The UTA Central Library curated the exhibit, &quot;Quanah &amp; Cynthia Ann Parker: A Pictorial Exhibit of their Story&quot; in 2014.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>An example of one conflict was the 1836 raid on Fort Parker, about 40 miles east of present-day Waco. Historians have called it the most famous Indian raid in Texas history, involving several hundred Comanches. During the attack, a raiding party massacred many Anglo-Americans and kidnapped 9-year-old Cynthia Ann Parker. Over the following years, she became wife to a Comanche chief and mother to his children, including son Quanah. After Texas Rangers recaptured Cynthia Ann and took her back to her birth family, Quanah became one of the most important Comanche leaders in both war and peace.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s no evidence of a Comanche raiding party of that size in the area at the time. It&#x2019;s more likely that the attack was carried out by local Wichita Indians, who had been fighting off and on with the inhabitants of the fort for over a year,&#x201D; Haynes noted.</p>\n<p>By compiling a database to map these sites of violence, the Border Land project will enable scholars to learn more about the movement &#x2013; and therefore the intentions &#x2013; of specific tribes.</p>\n<p>Mapping the sites also is key because some Anglo and Mexican accounts often failed to distinguish between one Indian tribe and another, Haynes said. To further complicate matters, some accounts were written for the general public &#x2013; captivity narratives, for example &#x2013; and are untrustworthy as they tended to sensationalize encounters with Native Americans.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Even the best studies of Native Americans in Texas pay very little attention to situating them spatially,&#x201D; said Haynes. &#x201C;We can better understand why these conflicts occurred in ways that were never clear before.&quot;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption250\"><img alt id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/haynes-book-cover-2016.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Haynes recently explored the broad, transnational approach to Texas&#x2019;s secession from Mexico in &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.tamupress.com/product/Contested-Empire,8240.aspx\">Contested Empire: Rethinking the Texas Revolution</a> (2015, Texas A&amp;M University Press),&#x201D; which he co-edited with Gerald Saxon, an associate professor of history and former dean of the UTA Libraries. The Border Land digital project and Contested Empire book are both part of Haynes&#x2019; larger research project: a reconceptualization of the clash of peoples in Texas during the early decades of the 19th century. The Border Land project will collect information in a database, then map events to a website, overlaying them onto both historical and current maps to show where the events cluster.</p>\n<p>Holmes and Ben Huseman, a UTA cartographic archivist, selected an 1835 map from the Library&#x2019;s Special Collections to be scanned. The grant will be used for a graduate research assistant to work on the geographic information system or GIS portion of the project. The GIS helps to visualize, analyze and interpret data to understand relationships, patterns and trends. The funding also will help to hire a student worker to enter metadata into the database, and for a graduate research assistant to collect data from the 1820s and 1830s.</p>\n<p>The team plans to secure additional funding as they achieve results. The funds would be used to continue data collections for all decades up to the beginning of the U.S.-Mexico War.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This project represents a great opportunity for Library staff to develop their experience with mapping data on a website using GIS tools,&#x201D; Holmes said. &#x201C;Once we understand exactly how this all overlays and works, we can begin overlaying it on some of the interesting documents we have that are unique to the University and Special Collections.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of more than 51,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Cooper</a> to develop the smart seat cushion technology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This type of active monitoring and pressure relief would improve pressure ulcer prevention strategies and reduce the workload of caregivers,&#x201D; Wijesundara said. &#x201C;Most importantly, this method would impact both the healthcare cost and quality of life for wheelchair users and their caregivers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"pds-appointment\">Cooper is a world-renowned expert in smart sensors, wheeled mobility and assistive devices for mobility impairment. He is also co-director of the&#xA0;National Science Foundation&#x2019;s Quality of Life Technology Engineering Research Center, a joint effort between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.</p>\n<p class=\"pds-appointment\">&#x201C;The research and development of the smart seat cushion would be beneficial to all people with mobility impairment,&#x201D; Cooper said. &#x201C;The less someone has to worry about the pain of ulcers, along with expensive and inadequate treatments, the sooner they can focus on other aspects of getting on with their lives and pursuing their ambitions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">The project is representative of research excellence that is advancing UTA&#x2019;s commitment to improve health and the human condition under the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">The act of sitting in a wheelchair can have unhealthy implications for people with limited mobility. Mechanical loading forces cause compression and shearing in tissues near bony regions such as the tailbone. If these loading forces are not relieved, blood flow is dramatically reduced and tissues begin to die. These lesions &#x2013; known as pressure ulcers &#x2013; can result in tissue loss, bone infection or sepsis.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Once pressure ulcers form, they are notoriously difficult, costly and time consuming to treat. A serious pressure ulcer requires months of treatment with costs running into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to the <i>Journal of Wound Care</i>.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Smart seat cushion technology will include real-time pressure monitoring and automated pressure modulation capabilities to help combat the formation and prevalence of pressure ulcers.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">A network of sensors will generate a pressure profile map and identify vulnerable areas where pressure relief is needed. Automated pressure modulation will use this data to reconfigure the seat cushion surface to offload pressure from sensitive areas. Additionally, the seat cushion can periodically change the pressure profile to eliminate pressure buildup over time.</p>\n<p class=\"pds-appointment\">UTARI Executive Director Mickey McCabe said the smart cushion project is a wonderful example of UTARI&#x2019;s drive to develop technologies that can be commercialized in order to improve a person&#x2019;s quality of life.</p>\n<p class=\"pds-appointment\">&#x201C;In this case, we&#x2019;re helping the users of wheelchairs to overcome an uncomfortable and even life-threatening side effect of mobility impairment,&#x201D; McCabe said. &#x201C;This grant brings us one step closer to developing a device that will ultimately improve health and the human condition for the benefit of society.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>This work was supported by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs through the Spinal Cord Injury Research Program under Award No. W81XWH-15-1-0719.

Conrad Greer, an internationally recognized petroleum engineer and chemist who is known for his extensive work in the evaluation of oil and gas properties, reservoir engineering, the development of enhanced oil recovery methods and development of industrial catalyst.</p>\n<p>Greer, who recently retired as Greenway&#x2019;s chief executive officer, has been a longtime UTA supporter, said Raymond Wright, Greenway&#x2019;s founder and current CEO. Wright said Greer is passionate about innovation in the development of alternative fuels and came up with the concept for Greenway as he watched U.S. natural gas exploration and production soar in the U.S. over the past two decades.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The explosion in the supply of natural gas in the U.S. opened the door to pursue the exploration of changing natural gas to liquid diesel and jet fuel with an innovative approach,&#x201D; Wright said. &#x201C;The approach UTA has developed in conjunction with Greenway makes for the cleanest, most environmentally friendly method of converting supplies to ready-to-market fuel.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Greenway is pleased to support these world-class researchers as we know that their work will have a lasting, global impact.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The gift and expanded research focus in alternative fuels will advance the University&#x2019;s efforts to address critical issues affecting the planet under the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/themes/impact.php\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, especially under the guiding theme of <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/initiatives/impact.php\">Global Environmental Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>UTA President Vistasp M. Karbhari said, &#x201C;We are most appreciative for the foresight Greenway Innovative Energy has shown in its support for furthering the critical work Dr. Dennis and Dr. MacDonnell are doing in the area of alternative fuels, which will ultimately allow the U.S. to maximize its natural resources and ensure energy independence. The integration of University research and industry expertise is a hallmark of enabling synergies to speed up innovation through impactful research.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Greenway Innovative Energy is a subsidiary of Fort Worth-based UMED Holdings Inc., which previously worked with the University on pioneering portable, small-scale units that can convert natural gas to liquids, such as diesel oil and jet fuel.</p>\n<p>Wright said that the UTA/Greenway technology &#x201C;makes for a more affordable process of producing a pure high-blend diesel fuel at a low cost per barrel. The process also eliminates the need to flare natural gas into the atmosphere and converts it to diesel fuel at the production site.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dennis and MacDonnell have improved gas-to-liquid technology in UTA&#x2019;s Center for Renewable Energy and Science Technology, or CREST, lab. The Conrad Greer Lab will be adjacent to the CREST lab in Science Hall.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We have a system in use that produces the high-grade fuel, but the new lab will allow us to produce larger quantities,&#x201D; Dennis said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a big step in the drive to show the scalability of the technology.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>MacDonnell said the high-grade nature of the diesel fuel is important to energy companies that want to mix it with lower grade fuels that are plentiful.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This high grade diesel would be sold to a refinery as an important blend feedstock,&#x201D; MacDonnell said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a proven technology but is generally only practical at a huge scale. We are working to make it practical and affordable on the smaller scale that Greenway wants to make the process more portable so they can target stranded gas resources that are otherwise difficult to develop.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington </span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research 1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of more than 50,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

        "body": "\n<p>Enrollment at The University of Texas at Arlington reached a record 38,650 Texas-based students for the spring 2016 semester, a figure that is up 6 percent from a year ago. At a time when most universities see declines in enrollment from fall to spring, UTA&#x2019;s numbers rose 4.4 percent from fall of 2015 when enrollment was 37,008.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption450\"><img alt=\"Spring enrollment hits record high.\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/spring-2016-enrollment.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>UTA Spring 2016 enrollment has hit a record high number of students.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The university now has a total of 50,661 degree seeking students on campus and in online degree programs. That number is projected to climb to 55,000 this year as new sections of online nursing and education degree programs begin throughout the spring and summer.</p>\n<p>A newly designated Research-1 university by the Carnegie Classification, UTA is one of the state&#x2019;s largest public research institutions and the second largest in The University of Texas System.</p>\n<p>The enrollment report showed the UTA <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/\">College of Engineering</a>, now the third largest in the state of Texas, increased enrollment 13 percent over the previous spring. The <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/index.php\">College of Nursing and Health Innovation</a> enrollment grew 16 percent over spring 2015 and is now the largest producer of well educated nurses in Texas and the third&#xA0;largest in the nation. The <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/coed/\">College of Education</a> also saw healthy growth with a 4 percent increase over spring 2015.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These numbers continue to demonstrate that UTA is increasingly an institution of first choice for students across Texas and globally, due to our faculty of national renown, cutting edge research, and focus on maintaining accessibility and affordability,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp M. Karbhari. &#x201C;We are increasingly providing our students with unique experiences such as undergraduate research opportunities that distinguish UTA in the collegiate landscape.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>State Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, congratulated UTA faculty, students and staff on the enrollment report.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is truly becoming a global leader in education and delivering it effectively to students in the many ways they now receive instruction,&#x201D; Krause said. &#x201C;Strong, vibrant universities are intrinsically drivers of the economy in the communities in which they are based; and UTA is rapidly becoming one of Arlington&#x2019;s and North Texas&#x2019;s greatest assets.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The spring enrollment report underscores UTA&#x2019;s commitment to ensuring that all Texans have the opportunity to earn a college degree of quality in areas of critical need. UTA met the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board&#x2019;s 2015 &#x201C;Closing the Gaps&#x201D; enrollment goals a year ahead of schedule and has increased enrollment by 102.8 percent since 2000. UTA is well positioned to help lead the state&#x2019;s new <a href=\"http://www.thecb.state.tx.us\">60x30 initiative</a> and contribute to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board&#x2019;s target of ensuring that at least 60 percent of Texans ages 25 to 34 have a certificate or degree by 2030.</p>\n<p>From its 24 high school-based &#x201C;GO Centers&#x201D; and the landmark University Crossroads program in Dallas, both of which focus on engaging students and preparing them for college, to the Bound for Success program with Arlington, Grand Prairie and Mansfield school districts, the STEM Academy with the Arlington Independent School District, and the increased and closer partnerships with Community College Districts, UTA is focused on forging ties that benefit student progress and success.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is committed to expanding every opportunity for Texans to earn their college degrees and to creating innovative partnerships that smooth the path for students,&#x201D; said Linda K. Johnsrud, interim provost and vice president for academic affairs. &#x201C;We know that a college education opens unlimited possibilities for each graduate, and we want to make sure that no matter where a student begins earning college credit, they will experience an easy transition to UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan with its focus on excellence while ensuring access, has also led to the recruitment of the very best faculty, along with <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/uta/faculty-opportunities/\">50 new tenure and tenure-track faculty members</a> in the colleges of Business; Engineering; Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs; Science; Liberal Arts; and Nursing and Health Innovation. More faculty positions will be added throughout 2016 and in future years as the university continues to rise to preeminence as the model 21<sup>st</sup> century public urban research university.</p>\n<p>Sustained enrollment gains have also fueled increased UTA achievements in the area of college completion. The University awarded 10,585 degrees in the 2014-15 academic year, making it the third largest producer of intellectual capital in Texas.</p>\n<p>Of those degrees, almost 3,400 were awarded to graduates of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, which produced 44 percent of the state&#x2019;s pre-nursing licensure graduates in 2014, according to preliminary reports from the Texas Board of Nursing.</p>\n<p>The university also achieved a critical goal in the 2014-15 academic year with 216 doctoral degrees awarded and more than 200 for the second consecutive year.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of more than 50,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System. The Chronicle of Higher Education ranked UTA as one of the 20 fastest-growing public research universities in the nation in 2014.

Bottom, Joseph Bohanon, left, was honored as founder of NASA at UTA. He teaches Native American studies and psychology at Southeastern Oklahoma State University and is the co-owner of Native Insights Consulting Firm.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The event will be held 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 27, in the E.H. Hereford University Center Bluebonnet Ballroom, 300 W. First St. Admission is free and open to the public. The Powwow is sponsored by the UTA Native American Student Association, which is the longest, continuously running college Native student group in Texas.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;A lot of Native American student associations go out of existence because of various issues, but UTA&#x2019;s NASA has survived because of the support of the community and hard work of the students, both Native and non-Native,&#x201D; said Kenneth Roemer, a longtime UTA NASA faculty advisor, Distinguished Teaching Professor, Distinguished Scholar Professor and expert in American Indian literature. &#x201C;The UTA community and the Metroplex have benefited from a variety of programs sponsored or co-sponsored by NASA since the mid-1990s, which include exhibits, workshops, talks, films, performances and events such as the Powwows.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>These events and scholarships NASA offers were some of the reasons why the American Indian Science and Engineering Society&#x2019;s <i>Winds of Change</i> magazine named UTA to the 2015-16 <a href=\"http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/pohlyco/woc_2015college/#/48\">&#x201C;Top 200 Colleges for Native Americans&#x201D; list</a>. The schools are presented in alphabetical order by state and are not ranked. UTA is the only UT System school to be named to the list.</p>\n<p>In addition to community support, evaluators focused on the academic support system, from admission to graduation; the availability for all students and Native Americans to earn science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) undergraduate degrees; And, the six-year graduation rate for all undergraduates and for American Indians.</p>\n<p>State Rep. Roberto Alonzo, D-Dallas, congratulated UTA on the longevity of its NASA organization and recognition as a top school for Native American students.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I am especially proud of UTA&#x2019;s accomplishments, which speak to the University&#x2019;s elevation as a major research institution and culturally relevant campus,&#x201D; said Alonzo, who in 2013 authored House Bill 174, which created the first <a href=\"http://americanindianheritagedayintexas.com/\">American Indian Heritage Day in Texas</a>. Much of HB 174 was written on the UTA campus.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA has continued to distinguish itself as a school of unprecedented excellence and is truly becoming the model for what a 21st century urban research university should be,&#x201D; said Alonzo, echoing the themes and aspirations of the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, which has a focus on research, teaching and community engagement.</p>\n<p>Roemer noted that more than 32 scholarships have been awarded to students since the UTA NASA was founded in 1994. He added that, besides his own work on Native literature, the research activities of many UTA faculty, staff and students relate mainly or in part to Native Americans and have garnered national recognition, among them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anthropology: Joseph Bastien (ret.) professor</li>\n<li>Art: Darryl Lauster, assistant professor</li>\n<li>Business: Myrtle Bell, professor</li>\n<li>History: Robert Caldwell, graduate teaching assistant, Ph.D. student; Paul Conrad, assistant professor</li>\n<li>Interdisciplinary Studies: Donna Akers, associate professor and director (Choctaw)</li>\n<li>Liberal Arts: Les Riding-In, assistant dean and director of Graduate Programs (Pawnee-Osage)</li>\n<li>Linguistics: Colleen Fitzgerald, professor</li>\n<li>Multicultural Affairs: Leticia Martinez, director</li>\n<li>Social Work: Maria Scannapieco, professor and director for the Center for Child Welfare</li>\n<li>Sociology: Krystal Beamon, associate professor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Departments that regularly offer courses related to Native Americans include Anthropology, English, History, Interdisciplinary Studies, and Linguistics. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, UTA hosted the Native Revisioning Football Classic. The high school football players came from as many as 30 different reservations.</p>\n<p><b>Powwow, pageantry and prayer</b></p>\n<p>Many of the 120 Native American tribal affiliations in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area will be represented at the Feb. 27 Powwow, which offers something for everyone. Michael Burgess, president of Pawnee Nation College in Pawnee, Okla., will serve as master of ceremonies.</p>\n<p>In addition to a tribute and ceremonial prayer for Native warriors and all military service people, the Powwow will honor the life and contributions of the late Dr. Rodney Stapp, a member of the Comanche Nation.</p>\n<p>Stapp worked in the telecommunications field, but switched to podiatric medicine after his mother lost both her legs to diabetes. He consulted with Nike on the Nike Air Native N7 shoe, which helps to prevent foot ulcers in diabetic patients. Dr. Stapp also served as chief executive officer of Dallas&#x2019; Urban Inter-Tribal Center, a place dedicated to the health, care and trust of the Native American community. Stapp, 54, died last month in a car accident.</p>\n<p>The Powwow will host a film festival from 11:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. See a list of the films to be screened at <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/UTA.powwow\">www.facebook.com/UTA.powwow</a>.</p>\n<p>Other highlights include traditional drumming, and dancers in full regalia. The clothing is considered a unique expression of spirit, often comprised of heirlooms and other articles handmade by family and friends handed down from generation to generation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These events give Native American community members a chance, in some cases, to connect with relatives from across Texas and often from Oklahoma,&#x201D; Roemer said. &#x201C;Some people come to hear songs that are very sacred to them; others come to dance and enjoy a purely social gathering.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Stephanie Vielle, president of the UTA NASA, said for non-Native Americans, the Powwow presents an opportunity to learn about Native American culture and to patronize vendors who will offer up delectables such as fry bread or Indian tacos. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Some visitors know very little about this world, which is why the emcee explains Powwow terms over and over again,&#x201D; said Vielle, a senior political science major and citizen of the Blackfeet tribe. &#x201C;The drum, for example, is recognized as the heartbeat of our people, but we want all people to understand its significance. Our culture and history is America&#x2019;s story.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/powwow\">www.uta.edu/powwow</a> for more information about UTA&#x2019;s 21st Annual Powwow.

The program is structured, tailored to the individual and includes aerobic exercise, strength training and stretching techniques. It is designed to mitigate the debilitating effects of chemotherapy and radiation.</p>\n<p>Studies show that cancer patients who exercise during and after treatment improve their cardiorespiratory fitness and quality of life, said Mark Haykowsky, a professor in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation and Moritz Chair of Geriatric Nursing and Research at UTA. Haykowsky is directing the program at UTA.</p>\n<p>Dr. Gary Kimmel, founder of FitSTEPS for Life and board chair emeritus of Tyler-based Cancer Foundation for Life, said cancer patients who exercise while being treated with chemotherapy typically experience less nausea as well as a significant reduction in fatigue.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Pre-clinical studies suggest that if patients exercise during treatment chemotherapy may be more effective in targeting cancer cells,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Some of these drugs damage your heart. But if you are exercising the effects of the drugs on the heart are mitigated.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>There are currently 12 FitSTEPS for Life programs in Texas, including six in the Dallas-Fort Worth region. The newest FitSTEPS program is housed at UTA&#x2019;s Maverick Activities Center and is the first in the Fort Worth-Arlington area.</p>\n<p>The program officially kicked off on the UTA campus in late February. But the college&#x2019;s Department of Kinesiology has had a relationship with FitSTEPS for several years, said David Keller, associate dean of the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/index.php\">College of Nursing and Health Innovation</a>.</p>\n<p>During that period, several undergraduate kinesiology students have completed their required internships at various FitSTEPS sites, said Keller, who is also chair of kinesiology. He called this new partnership an important evolution in the relationship with the foundation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a good opportunity for the community, our students and faculty alike,&#x201D; Keller said. &#x201C;We are the first site in the Arlington area to offer this program. If you live in the Arlington area, Grand Prairie, Mansfield, etc., and are in need of this program we offer a much more convenient option.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>State Rep. Stephanie Klick, R-Fort Worth, is a former nurse and healthcare administrator who serves on the Texas House of Representatives Human Services Committee. She said UTA&#x2019;s partnership with the foundation is the kind of collaboration that strengthens health care across the region.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Having FitSTEPS for Life in this region of North Texas is a boon for our community and other nearby communities,&#x201D; Klick said. &#x201C;I have seen first-hand the devastating impact of cancer on several of my constituents. I have seen how so many of these cancer patients struggle unsuccessfully to regain their full health and strength after treatment. This is definitely a great resource for this area.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Free parking at the Maverick Activities Center is provided to all participants. Haykowsky said the program is another great tool for building ties with the surrounding communities and making the university&#x2019;s resources available to all people.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re trying to increase ties to the community,&#x201D; said Haykowsky. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re getting out in the community and bringing the community to UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Kimmel said UTA&#x2019;s central location, close proximity to three major health systems with strong oncology centers and commitment to forging strong community relationships made it a natural fit for this partnership.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA has an interest in serving the community,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;This integrates them with the healthcare community. UTA has professors interested in doing research and this connects them with the patient population.&#xA0; It also provides internship opportunities for students.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Anne Bavier, dean of University of Texas at Arlington <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/index.php\">College of Nursing and Health Innovation</a>, called the program an important part of the university&#x2019;s long-term objectives in teaching, research and service. She noted that improving health and the human condition is one of the four guiding themes of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020</a>: Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A community&#x2019;s greatest asset is a healthy, thriving population,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;While scientists have yet to find a cure for cancer, the strides made in recent decades have been very encouraging. Partnerships of this kind help ensure better survival rates for cancer patients in our community. They also help ensure a better quality of life. Helping tackle such real life problems is a critically important part of our reason for being as a health-focused college and as a university.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of more than 50,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Victory Media also ranked UTA No. 9 among its Top Ten Tier 1 research institutions on its Military Friendly Schools 2018 list and awarded UTA gold status for its commitment to serving veterans.</p>\n<p>Approximately 5,000 student veterans and military-connected family members are currently pursuing degrees at UTA, or about 11.5 percent of the University&#x2019;s enrollment, as reported to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is an honor to be recognized as the nation&#x2019;s best school for veterans pursing nursing degrees and among the five best in the nation for veterans pursuing careers in the field of social work. But the true honor is in serving our veterans as they transition to the next phase of their lives, choosing to further their pursuit of excellence by earning a UTA degree in fields of study where there is a great need for our state and nation,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp Karbhari.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The University recently enhanced services offered to veterans and added an executive director of veteran programs. Under the direction of James Kumm, a combat veteran and seasoned higher education administrator, the University launched a&#xA0;<a href=\"https://blog.uta.edu/vac/\">veterans assistance website</a>&#xA0;and has plans to open a new Veterans Resource Center, which will be a one-stop-shop for veterans to receive assistance before they enroll, while they are students, and even after they earn a degree through specialized career placement services.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is already successfully integrating our student veterans and military-connected families with amazing programs on campus, but we want to continue to do more,&#x201D; Kumm said. &#x201C;We believe if we can track their progress and intervene when someone needs us, this deserving population will get the most out of their experience at UTA. In turn, the Texas labor force will see an infusion of highly skilled veterans, which are immediate assets to any industry.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Retired U.S. Army Gen. Benjamin Griffin, special advisor to Karbhari on veteran affairs, said the work UTA is doing to serve this population is to be commended.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is a pleasure to serve this university and witness UTA&#x2019;s commitment to excellence,&#x201D; Griffin said. &#x201C;This is especially true when it comes to providing guidance, assistance and opportunity to the men and women who served our nation and their families. UTA is excelling in extraordinary ways, and I&#x2019;m proud to be a part of it all.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n"

Smith-Osborne said research suggests individuals who receive treatment early on can avoid co-morbidity.</p>\n<p>Common disorders students receive treatment for include: ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and separation anxiety disorder.</p>\n<p>ADHD is most prevalent among adolescents and can lead to oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder and substance abuse in adulthood, Smith-Osborne said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A national co-morbidity study estimates the population in America that is least likely to receive treatment is children,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p>A mix of community and school district patients with co-morbid diagnoses include: 13 percent with anxiety disorders, 6 percent with major depressive disorder and 6 percent enuresis &#x2013; involuntary urination.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/ssw-aisd-play-therapy-room.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Center for Clinical Social Work&apos;s play therapy room</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Studies show children are being diagnosed with autism, ADHD and bipolar disorders at increasing rates, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p>Smith-Osborne said though studies also point to the fact that perceived increases could be due to improved reporting and access to healthcare, trends indicate children need more help, regardless.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Trends suggest that many more children need treatment and can benefit from earlier treatment to prevent/ameliorate the impact on their development,&#x201D; Smith-Osborne said.</p>\n<p>The center&#x2019;s staff uses evidence-based interventions in a step-by-step process to provide treatments after the children are diagnosed following protocols of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.</p>\n<p>The DSM-5, which is published by the American Psychiatric Association, is the industry&#x2019;s standard for classifying mental disorders.</p>\n<p>Smith-Osborne and her team also work with medication prescribers to monitor how the children are responding. She also reviews every case along the way using objective measures of improvement.</p>\n<p>Teachers within the school district are also involved.</p>\n<p>Many of the patients&#x2019; parents have low health literacy and limited access to healthcare, Smith-Osborne said.</p>\n<p>Social workers at the center have helped parents apply for the Affordable Care Act to address those issues.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are proud of this long-standing partnership with the AISD,&#x201D; said Scott Ryan, dean of the School of Social Work. &#x201C;We provide a needed service in the community and for the school district, while giving our social work graduate students studying direct practice in mental health clinical-based experience.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The partnership aligns with UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, by addressing health management within physical, mental, emotional and social contexts.</p>\n<p>Smith-Osborne said mental health and physical health interact as the mind affects the body.

With LSAC being driven by a number of diversity initiatives, how will your presentation take the diverse population of participants into consideration?</b></p>\n<p><b>A:</b> The most important thing anyone needs to have as they prepare for the LSAT is accurate information about the test. This advice applies to individuals from diverse ethnic or socioeconomic backgrounds as well. So the first thing I will be talking about will be the format and content of the test. I&#x2019;ll be talking about the types of questions that are on the test and how to approach them, and I will also be talking about the importance of preparing for the test. While covering these topics, I will also address certain issues that might be of specific concern to diverse populations thinking of taking the LSAT&#x2014;misconceptions, misinformation, and myths about the test that often cause people to worry. For example, I&#x2019;ll discuss the question of whether you have to take an expensive test prep course in order to do well on the LSAT. (Short answer: no, you don&#x2019;t!)</p>\n<p><b>Q: What words of encouragement or advice would you offer first generation law students choosing to take the LSAT exam in pursuit of breaking into the legal profession?</b></p>\n<p><b>A:</b> Take advantage of the many resources that are available to you to gather information about the test and about law school in general. Talk to your pre-law advisor or similar advising resources your current school might have. Also do research on the Web. For example, our website, <a href=\"http://www.lsac.org\">www.lsac.org</a>, has a lot of information about the test and about law school. LSAC also has a website called DiscoverLaw, www.discoverlaw.org, that promotes diversity in law school and in the legal profession.</p>\n<p><b>Q. What does a day in the life of an item developer for the LSAC look like?</b></p>\n<p><b>A: </b>My colleagues and I typically spend our days working on test questions at various stages of development. We comb the Internet, periodicals, and libraries for possible source material, we write draft questions based on the source material, and we review one another&#x2019;s questions and revise them with an eye to correctness (one and only one correct answer), fairness, clarity, and overall quality. We also recheck all questions for correctness, fairness, clarity, and overall quality when they are put together into unscored test sections, and again when they are put together into test sections that will ultimately be scored.</p>\n<p><b>Q: Do people treat you like a celebrity when you attend events after they discover what exactly you do for the LSAC?</b></p>\n<p><b>A:</b> People are often surprised to meet someone who writes test questions, and some people even seem genuinely excited to be hearing about the test from someone who works on it. But while it would be great fun to be able to say that I get treated like a celebrity&#x2026; that might be pushing it just a little bit!</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington </span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of more than 50,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Since 1979, the College has inducted distinguished individuals who, through performance and example, have made significant contributions to the engineering profession.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Before joining AT&amp;T in 2011, Prabhu was chief executive officer of Tellabs, an Illinois optical network technologies company. He served as chief operating officer of Alcatel in Paris from 1991 to 2001. His career includes corporate leadership positions with Rockwell Telecom and Bell Laboratories. He also served as an adjunct UTA electrical engineering professor in the mid-1980s.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">He will remain in his current role at AT&amp;T while serving as a resource for UTA as it bolsters its research and teaching in his areas of expertise.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Prabhu expressed appreciation for the UTA recognition and noted UTA&#x2019;s increasing reputation for excellence and its recent &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; designation by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, the definitive list for the top doctoral research universities in the United States.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">&#x201C;I am honored to be named to the Hall of Achievement in the College of Engineering at The University of Texas at Arlington,&#x201D; Prabhu said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m excited to be affiliated with this incredible institution and look forward to being a resource for the students who will make a positive impact on the technologies of the future.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">UTA President Vistasp M. Karbhari said Prabhu&#x2019;s extensive experience in research, corporate leadership, innovation and venture funding will immediately amplify the College of Engineering&#x2019;s reputation on the global stage.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">&#x201C;Dr. Prabhu has an exceptional history of leadership and innovation, and his induction into the Engineering Hall of Achievement is well-deserved. We are delighted that Dr. Prabhu has accepted a position as research professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering which will allow him to be a resource for our students,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;Our partnership with AT&amp;T is an example of how a major research university such as UTA can leverage academic excellence with industry partners to create relationships that transform the student experience and strengthen University research leadership.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Prabhu&#x2019;s involvement with UTA will be of great benefit to the University and its research endeavors because his background meshes with areas in which UTA researchers excel, said Duane Dimos, UTA vice president for research.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">&#x201C;We are excited to recognize someone with a background in the areas of big data and cyber security, which are research areas in which we are highly active,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;Krish&#x2019;s extensive experience in these areas, and in leading &#x2013; and encouraging &#x2013; innovation at a major global corporation, will allow our current faculty and students to help develop transformative new programs and proposals to move us forward in the area of data-driven discovery.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Prabhu began his career in 1980 as a member of technical staff at Bell Laboratories where he was engaged in research on video coding and image processing. He joined Rockwell International in 1984 and led a team of engineers developing fiber optic telecom products that were deployed by companies such as MCI, Ameritech and Southwestern Bell.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Later, at Alcatel, he led a team that was the first to launch digital subscriber line or DSL products for broadband Internet access. These were widely deployed all over the world.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Prabhu also served as a partner at Morgenthaler Ventures, where he assisted in developing information technology and communications start-ups. He has advised industry-leading telecommunications and semiconductor companies and also has served on several public and private company boards.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Prabhu earned his Master of Science degree and doctorate in electrical engineering from the University of Pittsburgh. He received his Master of Science in physics from the Indian Institute of Technology and his Bachelor of Science in physics from Bangalore University.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Since joining AT&amp;T in 2011, Prabhu has overseen the company&#x2019;s global technology direction, which includes network innovation, product development and research, the intellectual property organization and the global supply chain organization.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">Hong Jiang, chair of the UTA Department of Computer Science and Engineering and a former National Science Foundation program director, said Prabhu will bolster the department&#x2019;s strengths in big data and cyber security &#x2013; critical areas of research identified for growth through the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">&#x201C;We are very fortunate to honor Dr. Prabhu, not only because of his long and illustrious career as a technology visionary and industrial leader, but also because he is an outstanding researcher and enabler of cutting-edge research and development,&#x201D; Jiang said.</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">&#x201C;His experience in leading AT&amp;T&#x2019;s research and development in the areas of big data analytics and cyber security will be tremendously valuable to our ongoing efforts to position ourselves at the national forefront of research and education in these areas. Dr. Prabhu is very personable and loves to teach, which, combined with his rich industrial and leadership experiences, will no doubt make him very popular among our students.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">The University&#x2019;s growing collaboration with AT&amp;T is furthering the University&#x2019;s work to advance <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a>. Several faculty members in Computer Science and Engineering and other disciplines are engaged in active research projects aligned with Prabhu&#x2019;s areas of expertise, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heng Huang, professor of computer science and engineering, who has secured more than $3 million in National Science Foundation grants to support big data analyses that could lead to earlier identification of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease; data mining of medical records data to help physicians personalize patient treatment, predict health care needs and identify risks that can lead to readmission; and building an interactive gene expression database.</li>\n<li>Physics professor Kaushik De, who is director of the UTA Center of Excellence for High Energy Physics, and Gergely Zaruba, a computer science and engineering professor, have collaborated with the Argonne and Brookhaven National Laboratories to develop a universal version of PanDA, a workload management system built to process huge volumes of data from experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland.

In that list, UTA placed No. 16 of the 125 U.S. institutions ranked.</p>\n<p>Support for veterans in the College of Business comes in part from Rebecca Neilson, a retired colonel in the U.S. Army reserve with 30 years of commissioned service. Neilson is assistant director of the Goolsby Leadership Academy and the director of Graduate Business Services in the College of Business.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The College of Business is very interested in the success of our veteran students.&#xA0; The faculty and staff work together to provide excellent support and educational opportunities.&#xA0; We appreciate our veterans and work with them to help them reach their educational goals.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA offers more than 180 rigorous degree programs in 10 different schools and colleges. Degree programs with the strongest enrollment among veterans are in the areas of nursing, social work, business, criminology and criminal justice and biology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We value the skills and experiences that military members and veterans bring to UTA,&#x201D; said Lisa Thompson, director of UTA&#x2019;s TRIO Pre-College and Veterans Upward Bound programs. &#x201C;The entire campus is committed to helping them reach their goal of achieving a degree and providing the services needed to support their educational pursuits.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The College of Nursing and Health Innovation, for example, offers a Veterans Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree. The VBSN program is an example of competency-based education, which awards academic credit for skills acquired in the workplace.</p>\n<p>The JP Morgan Chase Foundation awarded UTA a $122,000 grant in 2014 to fund educational opportunities such as those offered by the Student Veterans Project. The grant was part of the foundation&#x2019;s $1 million national commitment to helping veterans earn college degrees.</p>\n<p>Among UTA&#x2019;s many significant efforts to support veterans are the:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Veterans Assistance Center</b>, which provides advising, tutoring, mentoring, counseling, assistance with completing college, financial aid and GI Bill applications.</li>\n<li><b>VetSuccess on Campus</b>, a collaborative effort between UTA and the Department of Veterans Affairs that provides a full-time, experienced vocational counselor in the Veterans Assistance Center.</li>\n<li><b>Vet Lounge.</b>&#xA0;Located in the Central Library, the lounge provides a dedicated meeting place and study area for veterans.</li>\n<li><b>Veterans Upward Bound,&#xA0;</b>a free program for qualified veterans design to motivate and assist in the development of academic skills.</li>\n<li><b>Entrepreneurship Boot Camp for Veterans</b>, which offers cutting-edge, experiential training in entrepreneurship and small business management entirely free to post-9/11 veterans with service-connected disabilities.</li>\n<li><b>Student Veteran Project,&#xA0;</b>which offers free services to veterans who are undergraduates or thinking of returning to school from the School of Social Work.</li>\n<li><b>SALUTE, the National Student Veteran Honor Society</b>, which is designed to encourage veterans to strive to improve their grade point averages and advance to higher levels of recognition within SALUTE during their academic careers.</li>\n<li><b>Adapted Sports Programs.</b>&#xA0;Grants and awards to UTA have enabled expanded sports and recreation programming for disabled veterans.

His current research is focused on examining social welfare services necessary to protect women&#x2019;s reproductive health in conflict zones in developing countries.</p>\n<p>Scott Ryan, dean of the School of Social Work, commended Pillai on his election to the Royal Society for Public Health and many contributions to an important field of study.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Pillai is a jewel and we are so proud of his dedication to educating and mentoring students, along with his research and advocacy in women&#x2019;s rights and reproductive health,&#x201D; said Ryan. &#x201C;Because of Dr. Pillai and other faculty members in the School of Social Work, we have one of the best graduate programs in the nation and we look with pride to the internationally-recognized educational leadership that Dr. Pillai will continue to provide.&quot; &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Pillai&#x2019;s passion for women&#x2019;s health issues and women&#x2019;s reproductive rights stems from heartbreaking loss in 1976. His 26-year-old sister died while giving birth in India. She suffered from an ectopic pregnancy, which is when a fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus. It is an uncommon but serious pregnancy complication that requires immediate treatment.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;She was doing well economically, but didn&#x2019;t receive the right medical attention at the right time,&#x201D; Pillai said. &#x201C;I began to think about the women who weren&#x2019;t well off, those in underdeveloped countries and unable to afford proper care.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Pillai&#x2019;s research on the matter ensued and eventually led him to social demography work in Zambia, where he became very involved in public health.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I wrote policies concerning population issues, why they were happening and what solutions should be considered,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;In the end, everything led back to a link between women&#x2019;s rights and women&#x2019;s health.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The Society specifically recognized Pillai for his career commitment to the improvement of population health. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Being a member of a group of select public health professionals in one of the oldest public health societies in the world is truly humbling,&#x201D; Pillai said. &#x201C;I am profoundly grateful to be recognized in this manner and this honor will help further my opportunities to collaborate professionally, while extending my reach to vulnerable populations here in the U.S. and abroad.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The Royal Society for Public Health represents 6,500 public health educators and professionals in the fields of health promotion, environmental health, and medicine and food safety trainers.</p>\n<p>Pillai expressed special thanks to his colleagues and mentor, Jay Weinstein, who inspired him to pursue the field of public health and human rights while at the University of Iowa. But Pillai also credited his students for helping him achieve the honor.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In the end, securing any type of honor is only as good as what you do next,&#x201D; said Pillai, who earned the UTA Office of Graduate Studies&#x2019; 2013-14 Doctoral Mentoring Award. &#x201C;Although my work has been cited for bringing better understanding to women&#x2019;s rights and women&#x2019;s health, I am most proud of the young lives that I have been able to impact here at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He added: &#x201C;Many of my former School of Social Work students are succeeding in a variety of ways. And, when they succeed, it is validation of my efforts, which enables me to continue my work.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Pillai has studied reproductive health in conjunction with human rights issues in many African and Asian countries. That research led to his appointment as the editor of <i>Social Development Issues</i>, the journal of the International consortium on Social Development; an organization of practitioners, scholars and students in the human services.</p>\n<p>Pillai&#x2019;s previous projects include research on the role of social capital on the development of democratic attitudes in Latin American countries. He is the author of numerous studies, papers and books, including the internationally noted, &#x201C;<i>Women&#x2019;s Reproductive Rights in Developing Countries</i> (Ashgate, 1999).&#x201D; In addition to the Royal Society for Public Health, Pillai is a member of the American College of Epidemiology and World Society for Ekistics.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About the Royal Society for Public Health </span></b></p>\n<p>The Royal Society for Public Health is an independent, multi-disciplinary organization dedicated to the promotion and protection of collective human health and wellbeing.

Roads and their level of service should not be the sole method for assessing the efficacy of the transportation system. Cleaner air, improved access for all and fitter residents could be other criteria to consider and measure.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The project evaluates public health performance measures and their role in the regional metro transportation planning process. It links transportation decisions to public health, basically giving planners and decision makers a tool in which to measure these decisions. The system will take into account safety, air quality and physical activity.</p>\n<p>NCTCOG establishes the Metropolitan Transportation Plan, which is a multimodal blueprint for transportation systems and services aimed at meeting the mobility needs of the NCTCOG area during the next 25 years.</p>\n<p>Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price, a UTA Distinguished Alumna, has made fitness a central theme of her public service.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Integrating public health recommendations into transportation planning can tangibly help to improve the quality of life for our residents,&#x201D; Mayor Price said. &#x201C;Healthier communities are more engaged, friendly and productive. As residents explore active options to get around, including places to walk, bike, commute and exercise, communities that provide alternative transit options are becoming more attractive. Transportation systems that consider public health are the ones that will be more successful in the long run.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>NCTCOG Senior Transportation Planner Kendall Wendling said public health is an emerging topic in the transportation planning realm.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;NCTCOG plans to use the research from the study to integrate public health into its long-range transportation plan,&#x201D; Wendling said. &#x201C;This is beneficial research because NCTCOG is interested in quantifying the effects that transportation has on public health by establishing performance measures in the long-range transportation plan.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nan Ellin, dean of the College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs, said the blending of public health in a regional transportation plan mirrors the platform of creating more <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/communities.php\">sustainable communities</a> envisioned in UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020 | Bold Solutions: Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The research will inform transportation decisions that will enhance, rather than compromise, livability,&#x201D; Ellin said. &#x201C;Public health should be a vital part of any decision the region makes concerning transportation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the College of Engineering, said communities must develop alternatives to the ever-increasing demand for roads.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is an exciting example of how data from multiple disciplines can be integrated in order to achieve a higher level of efficiency and ease of transportation,&#x201D; Behbehani said.</p>\n<p>Casey and Mattingly said they want to make their recommendations user-friendly so that NCTCOG&#x2019;s entities can easily use their insights. The professors plan to compile best practices across the region and nation to create a menu of recommendations for NCTCOG members.</p>\n<p>Their work builds upon Mattingly&#x2019;s 2013 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to conduct research on a variety of topics related to the development of Livable Communities. Mattingly&#x2019;s grant places UTA in partnership with Western Michigan University, Wayne State University, Utah State University and Tennessee State University as researchers of the Transportation Research Center for Livable Communities.</p>\n<p>Co-principal investigators of the 2013 grant include Casey, Professors Sia Ardekani and James Williams of Civil Engineering and Professor Jianling Li in CAPPA.</p>\n<p>Casey is leading a TRCLC research study with Mattingly that supports the work for NCTCOG titled &#x201C;Developing Performance Measures To Capture the Effects of Transportation Facilities on Multiple Public Health Outcomes.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Other projects funded by the center focus on how the use of technology and crowd sourcing to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety, including transportation costs more effectively into affordable housing calculations and evaluating the transportation needs/gaps for the elderly non-driving population.</p>\n<p>Casey co-authored a published paper in <a href=\"http://pwm.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/01/05/1087724X14559520.abstract\">Public Works Management and Policy</a> that explored opportunities for engaging public health organizations in transportation planning in 2015. Co-authors were Li and Lou K. Brewer, Tarrant County health director.</p>\n<p>UTA has a robust education and research emphasis in transportation. Several professors and students make up the <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/ce/research/transportation-research-group.php\">Transportation Research Group</a>.</p>\n<p>Recent research projects and studies include: developing a comprehensive pricing evaluation model for managed lanes, developing an Irving bicycle and pedestrian safety study, developing an integrated or smart corridor management demonstration project and on-road measurement of air quality. NCTCOG, TxDOT, the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Texas Transportation Institute have supported these projects and others under way.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington </span></b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of more than 50,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

It is a great honor for any individual and institution to be featured in the ECC exhibition held in conjunction with the 2020 Venice Architecture Biennale. It is also a very appropriate city for our research proposals in regards to using the watershed network in a city as an urban generator. We are honored by the grant and opportunity to further develop our research,&#x201D; Sloan said.</p>\n<p>The European Cultural Center biennale exhibition and Venice Architecture Biennale is from May 23, 2020, through Nov. 29, 2020.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">See a video of the event <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5rE2ptSAwY&amp;\">here</a>.</p>\n--&#xA0;&#xA0;<i>Written by Caroline Stultz</i></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n"

Helping fill those positions is The University of Texas at Arlington&#x2019;s Master of Construction Management program, which was recently ranked for the education it provides its graduates.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/construction-management-onlinemasters-ranking.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The Master of Construction Management program, which began in 2014 and currently has 164 students, was tabbed at No. 21 nationally on <a href=\"https://www.onlinemasters.com/best-degree-programs/construction-management/\">OnlineMasters.com&#x2019;s</a> list of Best Online Master&#x2019;s in Construction Management Programs. UTA was also recognized as having the best interdisciplinary studies among the ranked programs.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Texas continues to be one of the fastest-growing parts of the country. Currently, the Dallas-Fort Worth area alone is the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the country. The need to accommodate that growth will require a trained, professional workforce skilled at construction management and construction engineering techniques,&#x201D; said Dan Lamers, senior program manager for the North Central Texas Council of Governments.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA does a tremendous job of preparing young engineers, and particularly construction managers, for the real-world challenges they&#x2019;ll face when they graduate and get jobs within our region.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Students in the program take core courses in construction along with classes focused on one of three tracks: commercial and residential, infrastructure and heavy/highway, and general construction management. The program includes courses in business, architecture and management, which OnlineMasters.com cited as a reason for awarding the best interdisciplinary studies honor, stating, &#x201C;In this interdisciplinary program, students develop knowledge across numerous industries and improve their skill set for career advancement in the world of construction management and administration.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>That variety is a key component to its success, says Bijan Shapoorian, director of the Construction Management program.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are basically training the students to be familiar with what is required to deliver a construction project. There is a high demand for this major,&#x201D; Shapoorian said.</p>\n<p>In addition to the master&#x2019;s program, UTA added an undergraduate degree program in construction management in 2017. Enrollment doubled from 63 students in spring 2018 to 127 in spring 2019.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are committed to meeting the needs of the region in education and research. We were happy to add our construction management programs to fill a void in the construction workforce in the region, and earning a ranking for the quality of our online master&#x2019;s program is an honor that confirms that we are doing things the right way,&#x201D; said Ali Abolmaali, chair of the Department of Civil Engineering, which houses the construction management program.</p>\n<p>OnlineMasters.com analyzed every online Master of Construction Management program in the United States and consulted 18 industry experts, hiring managers, current students and alumni to identify the best programs based on a methodology that took into account each program&#x2019;s academic quality, student success and affordability.</p>\n<p>UTA was also ranked No. 10 for Best Master&#x2019;s in Construction Management for 2019 by bestcollegereviews.com.</p>\n<p>The Civil Engineering Department&#x2019;s faculty, staff and students have transformed the department to a new level of excellence in research and teaching that directly addresses local and national engineering needs by providing innovative solutions to the most challenging problems facing this country&#x2019;s infrastructure. The American Society of Civil Engineers&#x2019; Structural Engineering Institute honored UTA&#x2019;s ASCE Graduate Student Chapter as its graduate student chapter of the year in 2017.

Athletes first have to qualify at state tournaments and then be selected from the field at national championships. Munoz said she has eight national championship titles since she started competing in 2013.</p>\n<p>Munoz started taekwondo when she was 10. She began training in Fort Bragg, N.C., where her father, Joe, was stationed in the Army. Munoz first trained under legendary Grandmaster Myong Sok Namkung Mayes, who became the first female in the world to reach the highest black belt taekwondo level as a 9<sup>th</sup> degree Dan.</p>\n<p>Munoz also credits the help of taekwondo coach Barbara Brand, a three-time world championship bronze medalist. She met Brand at the world championships in 2014 and started training with her not long afterward.</p>\n<p>But Munoz&#x2019;s primary taekwondo coach in Texas has been her father. Joe Munoz spent 25 years in the Army before retiring. He&#x2019;s owned Texas Forge Taekwondo (<a href=\"http://www.texasforgetkd.com\">www.texasforgetkd.com</a>) since October 2015.

Broekhoven mentioned a Dasgupta paper titled &#x201C;Flow-cell-induced dispersion in flow-through absorbance detection systems: true column effluent peak variance&#x201D; from 2018.</p>\n<p>Dasgupta is the Hamish Small Chair in Ion Analysis in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. He has been at The University of Texas at Arlington since 2007.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I was very honored,&#x201D; Dasgupta said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s especially humbling when a colleague says your work was important to them. I&#x2019;m glad my paper and its findings meant something to a colleague.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The paper concerned Dasgupta&#x2019;s major research areas of chromatography, which is the separation of a material into as many components as possible. Among other components, a detector is placed at the end of a column to help separate large number of individual constituents in a sample. He said one of the challenges of chromatography is the detector which is essentially the component that &#x201C;watches&#x201D; the separation, itself causes some mixing and deteriorates the separation. The phenomenon is well recognized but since the detector is the agent which reports the separation, the degree to which the separation is being compromised is not exactly known. As Broekhoven has titled his note, <i>Who watches the watchman?</i> In this paper Dasgupta provides a way to quantitatively estimate how much the watchman is stealing and possibly how to correct for it.</p>\n<p>Dasgupta said his paper is applicable to many areas of chromatography, including pharmaceutical testing, food chemistry, chemical analysis and others.</p>\n<p>Dasgupta&#x2019;s work at UTA has led to many awards, in the last four years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He was named the 2018 <i>Distinguished Texas Scientist of the Year </i>by the Texas Academy of Science</li>\n<li>Received the <i>Chemical Instrumentation Award </i>from the American Chemical Society in 2018</li>\n<li>Named one of the top 10 inventors in <i>The Analytical Scientist</i> 2017 Power List.</li>\n<li>Earned the 2017 Talanta Medal, an international award that recognizes world leaders in the analytical chemistry field, he was the 4<sup>th</sup> American ever to receive this honor..</li>\n<li>Received the 2016 Tech Titan Inventor award for being a &#x201C;patent-making machine.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>Received the 2016 Eastern Analytical Symposium&#x2019;s highest award, an award for Outstanding Achievements in the Fields of Analytical Chemistry.</li>\n<li>Received the 2015 J.

Her\nco-author is Joshua A. T. Salzmann, assistant professor of history at\nNortheastern Illinois University.</p>\n<p>The\nresearchers found that while the league minimum salary remained at $6,000\nbetween 1954 and 1967, players&#x2019; average salaries soared to $16,000 in the\nmid-1960s. Teams paid these increasing salaries out of funds newly attained\nthrough television revenue. Between 1964 and 1979, revenues from television\ncontracts rose from $21 million to $54 million. </p>\n<p>During\nthis time, players and owners investigated new ways to preserve and,\neventually, enhance players&#x2019; bodies.</p>\n<p>The\npair interviewed notable sports figures such as Nolan Ryan and Bob Costas and a\nwide array of baseball players, team physicians, trainers, general managers,\nagents and union officials with careers dating back to the mid-1960s. The\narticle focuses on Sandy Koufax, Tommy John, Frank Jobe and Jos&#xE9; Canseco, who in his own book admitted to using\nperformance-enhancing drugs during his playing career. In fact, his tell-all\nclaimed that the large majority of Major League Baseball players used steroids.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Enticed\nby the prospect of riches, players and teams harnessed fitness training,\nreconstructive surgery, biomechanical analysis and performance-enhancing drugs\nto reduce wear and tear on players&#x2019; bodies and, ultimately, radically alter\nthem for profit,&#x201D; Rose and Salzmann concluded in the paper. &#x201C;This interplay\nbetween economic incentives and medicine created what we call bionic\nballplayers: bigger, stronger, and at times, more fragile than their\npredecessors.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The\nstudy suggests that the question raised by steroids is not individual morality,\nbut rather the morality produced by a political economy of labor that calls for\nboth services and body parts rendered.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Ironically,\nas Rose and Salzmann&#x2019;s article went to press, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig had\njust suspended 13 players for using steroids.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption250\"><img alt src=\"/news/images/sarah-rose.jpeg\" width=\"250\"><figcaption>Sarah Rose, labor and disability historian in the College of Liberal Arts</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;Why\nhas professional baseball players&#x2019; steroid use been characterized as an immoral\nillegitimate bodily enhancement, when other medical interventions, such as &#x2018;Tommy\nJohn&#x2019; elbow reconstruction surgery, have been celebrated as career-saving\ncures?&#x201D; Rose questioned. &#x201C;While admittedly different, we show that both bodily\ninterventions arose out of the same dramatic shifts in the business of baseball\n&#x2013; shifts that drove the medicalization of the game and players&#x2019; bodies.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The\nresearchers contend that before the advent of salary arbitration and free\nagency, ballplayers were disposable parts in a high-risk work environment.

One of those genes, they\nalso found, may be an example of a &#x201C;slippery gene&#x201D; more prone to evolutionary\nchanges.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Dr. Fondon and grad students\" src=\"/news/images/trey-fondon.jpeg\" width=\"300\"><figcaption>A research team led by John W. &quot;Trey&quot; Fondon, a UT Arlington assistant professor of biology, recently published a study on gene mutation in pigeons.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>John W. &#x201C;Trey&#x201D; Fondon, an\nassistant professor of biology, is co-author of a study that begins to unravel\nthe molecular basis for the color palette of domestic pigeons breeds known as\n&#x201C;fancy pigeons.&#x201D; Due mostly to organized breeding in Europe and Asia, there are\nhundreds of types of pigeons that have evolved to include numerous color\nvariations on the blue/black model, including shades of gray, red, and brown.</p>\n<p>The&#xA0;genes\nin the study have previously been linked to&#xA0;skin and hair color variation\namong people, as well as the development of melanoma.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The\npigeon really has been neglected as a model system, and we are changing that,&#x201D;\nFondon said, adding that such studies can help in an overall understanding of\nvertebrate systems. &#x201C;The things that shape diversity also shape disease.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The results are being published\nonline Feb. 6 in the journal <i>Current\nBiology</i>. Eric T. Domyan, a post-doctoral fellow in the lab of University of\nUtah professor Michael D. Shapiro, is lead author. </p>\n<p>Other co-authors include\nShapiro; Shreyas Krishnan and Clifford Rodgers, of UT Arlington; Zev\nKronenberg, Michael W. Guernsey, Anna Vickery and Mark Yandell, of University\nof Utah; Raymond E. Boissy, of the University of Cincinnati College of\nMedicine; and Pamela Cassidy and Sancy A. Leachman, of the Oregon Health &amp;\nScience University.</p>\n<p>Shapiro&#x2019;s team at University of\nUtah published research last year in the journal <i>Science</i> that revealed results from the first large-scale sequencing\nof the pigeon genome. That collection of more than 100 billion DNA bases from\n40 pigeons, provided the basis for the new work.</p>\n<p>Geneticists like Fondon have\nturned to dog breeds in the past to understand the molecular basis of phenotype\nchanges because dog breeds are so varied. Fondon said scientists hoping to\nunderstand more about how characteristics vary can find even greater\nstatistical power and diversity in studying domestic pigeons.</p>\n<p>Fondon&#x2019;s laboratory worked in\nparallel with researchers at Utah to find that coding and regulatory variations\nin the interactions among the genes Tyrp1, Sox10 and Slc45a2 control multiple\ncolor phenotypes, or appearances, in pigeons. For example, researchers found\nthat the ash-red mutation in Tyrp1, a gene that plays a large role in color\ndetermination, arose just once and was spread throughout the species by\nselective breeding.</p>\n<p>They also found that some color\nchanges evolved through changes in the same gene that happened at different\ntimes &#x2013; hinting at the existence of a &#x201C;slippery gene.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>Fondon&apos;s team found two\nindependent deletions of regulatory sequences near the Sox10 gene produce\n&#x201C;recessive red&#x201D; pigmentation. These mutations happened at different points in\nevolution, and researchers believe it is no coincidence they hit the same spot,\nas this same region is also deleted in color mutants of chickens and mice,\nFondon said. There are indications of yet more independent mutations of this\n&quot;hotspot.&quot; </p>\n<p>More research is needed, but\nFondon expects significant progress in understanding is on the horizon.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;These traits are falling like dominoes in\nterms of our understanding their genetic origins. It took hundreds of years to\nset them up and now they are just falling,&#x201D; Fondon said. </p>\n<p>The name of the new paper is\n&#x201C;Epistatic and combinatorial effects of pigmentary gene mutations in the\ndomestic pigeon.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>&quot;Dr.\nFondon is contributing important, essential discoveries to our understanding of\nhow genes change over time.

Through photosynthesis, the Amazon absorbs 1.5\nbillion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year in a process that\nrequires input of nitrogen. That nitrogen, for the most part, comes from a\nprocess called nitrogen fixation &#x2013; essentially microbes pulling nitrogen form\nthe air into the soil.</p>\n<p>The new paper, featured in the\nJanuary issue of<i> Applied and\nEnvironmental Microbiology</i>, looks for the first time at the reaction of\nfree-living nitrogen-fixing microorganisms called diazotrophs to the\ndeforestation. Jorge Rodrigues, an assistant professor of biology at The\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington, organized the work. Babur S. Mirza, formerly\na postdoctoral fellow in the Rodrigues lab, is the paper&apos;s lead author.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption200\"><img alt=\"AEM journal cover\" src=\"/news/images/aem-cover.jpeg\" width=\"200\"><figcaption>A photo from a new UT Arlington paper is on the cover of the January issue of Applied and Environmental Microbiology.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;This study\nshows that although the diversity of diazotrophic microorganisms remains the\nsame with the conversion from forest to pasture, the types of species found are\ndifferent,&#x201D; said Rodrigues. &#x201C;Our\nnext step is to measure how the rates of biological nitrogen fixation are\ninfluenced by community changes. Because the carbon and nitrogen cycles are so\nstrongly linked, our previous results indicated that changes in carbon dioxide\nsequestration will occur&quot;\n</p>\n<p>Rodrigues&#x2019; team gathered samples\nof soil from the Fazenda Nova Vida site in Rondonia, Brazil, one of three\nstates in the country that accounted for more than 85 percent of deforestation from\n1996 to 2005. They analyzed soil from a primary forest, a pasture established\nin 2004 and a secondary forest that resulted from the abandonment of a pasture\nin 1999. </p>\n<p>The team used DNA analysis,\nspecifically the nifH gene that is characteristic of diazotrophs, to measure\nthe communities in the samples.</p>\n<p>Rodrigues said researchers were\nsurprised to find a ten-fold increase in the number of diazotrophic\nmicroorganisms in the pasture established in 2004, when compared to the primary\nforests. They theorize the pasture ecosystems rely on the diazotrophs more for\nnitrogen because of the continuous grazing from cattle, requiring constant regrowth\nof grasses. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;We observed a complete shift in the diazotrophic\nmicrobial community composition in response to the Amazon rain forest\nconversion to a pasture,&#x201D; Mirza said. &#x201C;These differences an be attributed to\nthe shift in the above ground plant community because we did see partial\nrecovery of diazotroph community composition in the secondary forest, which\nhave more plant species as compared to pasture.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mirza said researchers are\ncontinuing their work with more more sophisticated sequencing technologies and\nin-depth sampling. </p>\n<p>Other co-authors on the new paper include Chotima Potisap, a\nvisiting Ph.D. student from Khon Kaen University in Thailand; Klaus N&#xFC;sslein, professor of microbiology at\nthe University of Massachusetts; and Brendan J.M. Bohannan, professor at the\nInstitute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Oregon.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>The paper is titled &#x201C;Response of Free-Living Nitrogen Fixing\nMicroorganisms to Land Use Change in the Amazon Rainforest&#x201D; and is available\nonline here:&#xA0; <a href=\"http://aem.asm.org/content/early/2013/10/21/AEM.02362-13.full.pdf+html\">http://aem.asm.org/content/early/2013/10/21/AEM.02362-13.full.pdf+html</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite worries about the effect\nthese changes to the microbial communities may have on the carbon cycle,\nRodrigues said there are some encouraging results. After pastures were\nabandoned and a secondary forest grew, partial restoration of the original\ndiazotrophic communities was achieved, researchers said. </p>\n<p>Growth of secondary forest is\nongoing for about 50 percent of the abandoned pastures in the Amazon, but more\nneeds to be done to encourage secondary forests and limit deforestation in the\nfirst place, Rodrigues said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There is still time to recover if we\nact now,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>An Agriculture and Food Research\nInitiative grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture supported the work\ndetailed in the paper.</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at\nArlington is a comprehensive research institution of more than 33,300 students\nand 2,300 faculty members in the epicenter of North Texas. It is the second\nlargest institution in The University of Texas System. Total research\nexpenditures reached almost $78 million last year.

Temporal strategies can be a source of advantage.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Some businesses changed their operating hours to coincide with the end of an event since food and refreshments at the event were expensive.

The paper is available online at <a href=\"http://www.aspbs.com/JBN/contents_jbn2014108.htm\">http://www.aspbs.com/JBN/contents_jbn2014108.htm</a>.</p>\n<p>The University has also filed a provisional patent application on the new complex.</p>\n<p>Photodynamic therapy, or PDT, harms cancer cells when a photosensitizer introduced into tumor tissue produces toxic singlet oxygen after being exposed to light. In some studies, this light exposure is done through use of visible or near-infrared lasers. Others have found more success by also introducing luminescent nanoparticles into the tumor. Researchers activate the luminescent nanoparticle with near-infrared light or X-rays, which in turn activates the photosensitizer.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Both methods have limitations for treating deep tissue cancers. They are either inefficient or the light source needed to activate them doesn&#x2019;t penetrate deep enough. Chen said that X-ray inducible Cu-Cy particles surpass current photosensitizers because the X-rays can penetrate deep into tissue. Also, Cu-Cy nanoparticles don&#x2019;t need other photosensitizes to be effective so the treatment is more convenient, efficient and cost-effective.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Chen&#x2019;s commitment to his work in cancer-related therapy, as well as his work in the area of homeland security, demonstrates the wide-ranging applications and great value of basic science research,&#x201D; said Carolyn Cason, vice president for research at UT Arlington. &#x201C;These advances have the potential to change the way some cancers are treated and make therapy more effective &#x2013; a benefit that would be boundless.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Chen&#x2019;s team tested the Cu-Cy on human breast and prostate cancer cells in the lab and found it to be an effective treatment when combined with X-ray exposure. In one test, for example, a tumor treated with Cu-Cy injection and X-ray exposure stayed virtually the same size over a 13-day period while a tumor without the full treatment grew by three times.</p>\n<p>Ma said: &quot;Photodynamic therapy is limited to treat superficial diseases such as skin cancer because current photosensitizers cannot be activated using high energy irradiations that are able to deeply penetrate into tissues. As a new photosensitizer, the Cu-Cy can be effectively activated by X-ray irradiation for cancer cell destruction. It may be a breakthrough to bring photodynamic therapy to deep cancer treatment.&quot;</p>\n<p>Another advantage of the new nanoparticle is a low toxicity to healthy cells. In addition, Cu-Cy&#x2019;s intense photoluminescence and X-ray luminescence can be used for cell imaging, the paper said.</p>\n<p>Details of the crystal structure and optical properties of the new complex are being published in an upcoming paper from the Journal of Materials Chemistry. It is available here: <a href=\"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2014/tc/c4tc00114a\">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2014/tc/c4tc00114a</a>.</p>\n<p>The UT Arlington team continues to pursue photodynamic cancer therapy research under a grant from the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs and with collaborations from industry. Further research will include reducing the size of the Cu-Cy nanoparticle to make it more easily absorbed in the tumor tissue.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;For cancer, there is still no good solution yet. Hopefully this nanoparticle can provide some possibilities,&#x201D; Chen said.</p>\n<p><b><span>About UT Arlington</span></b><b>&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution and the second largest institution in The University of Texas System. <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> ranked UT Arlington as the seventh fastest-growing public research university in 2013. <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> ranks UT Arlington fifth in the nation for undergraduate diversity.

The cancer cells behave differently as they come into contact with the nanotextured walls. They dance.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Identifying those &#x201C;dancing cells&#x201D; will help doctors pinpoint cancer cells and start treatment earlier than allowed with current technology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Discovering the cancer earlier, before it metastasizes, is essential to surviving cancer,&#x201D; Iqbal said. &#x201C;Our device has the potential to do that.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The published results stem from a 2014 $480,000 National Science Foundation grant that funded the design and creation of the device.</p>\n<p>Iqbal has received nearly $1.4 million in grants since his arrival at UTA in 2007. Those grants included an NSF CAREER grant to create a nanoelectronic microfluidic biochip to detect biomarkers. He also directs the UTA Nano-Bio Lab and is an affiliated faculty for the UTA Bioengineering Department. Iqbal also is an adjunct professor in the Department of Urology at UT Southwestern Medical Center.</p>\n<p>In addition to his numerous research accolades, Iqbal is a senior member of IEEE-USA, a member of Biomedical Engineering Society, American Physical Society, American Society of Mechanical Engineers and Biophysical Society.&#xA0;In 2013, Tau Beta Pi inducted him as an Eminent Engineer.</p>\n<p>Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the UTA <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/\">College of Engineering</a>, said Iqbal&#x2019;s research is groundbreaking.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Iqbal and his colleagues are bringing engineering innovation to meet the challenge of early cancer detection,&quot; Behbehani said. &#x201C;The research aligns with <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan</a>, particularly the focus on <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">Health and the Human Condition</a>.

But if matter and antimatter are produced equally, then all of the matter created in the early universe should have been cancelled out by equal amounts of antimatter, eliminating existence itself instantly. And we wouldn&#x2019;t be here.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Neutrinos and their antimatter antineutrinos oscillate as they move through space, changing &#x201C;flavor,&quot; form and mass.</p>\n<p>Scientists hope that by observing and comparing the oscillations of neutrinos and antineutrinos some difference will become apparent that could explain the matter-antimatter imbalance and hence how our universe came to exist.</p>\n<p>The DUNE experiment also could shed light on other physical processes such as Dark Matter, which have been largely unexplained up to now.</p>\n<p><b>What does the DUNE experiment involve? </b></p>\n<p>The DUNE experiment involves firing an intense neutrino beam from Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, to the DUNE far detector in the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota; a distance of 800 miles.</p>\n<p>The DUNE far detector is conceived as four vast liquid argon time projection chambers, each consisting of a total volume of 20,000 tons of liquid argon.</p>\n<p>These time projection chambers will provide 3D images of the particles produced in neutrino interactions.</p>\n<p>The first time projection chambers were developed in 1974 by David Nygren, Presidential Distinguished Professor of Physics in UTA&#x2019;s College of Science, to enable accurate and complete capture of results when high-energy particles collide. Such collisions can lead to the production of hundreds or even thousands of new particles.</p>\n<p>Since then, the time projection chamber has been used worldwide for more than three decades in particle detection and discovery, ranging from relativistic heavy ion collisions to the search for Dark Matter and extremely rare nuclear decays.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution of more than 51,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Dr. Pellegrino&#x2019;s discovery that mitochondria are an important activator of innate immunity was published in the leading journal <i>Nature</i> in 2014.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;When the mitochondria becomes dysfunctional, a pathway is activated in an attempt to repair itself,&#x201D; Pellegrino said. &#x201C;Down the line, I can envision that pathway being manipulated to develop new therapies for cancer.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Identification and diagnotics: treatments designed for each patient.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Big Data</b></p>\n<p>Precision medicine, or the development of treatments specifically designed for each patient, is one of the fastest-growing areas of cancer research, and requires core strength in both data mining and genomics to improve diagnostics and better predict treatment outcomes.</p>\n<p>The University, which already runs a Human Genomics Center through the Shimadzu Institute for Research Technologies as well as a Genomics Core Facility within its biology department, made several hires in 2016 to strengthen its capacity in computational modeling and the identification of biomarkers for cancer and received new large grants in this strategic focus area.</p>\n<p>Heng Huang, a UTA professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, won a $1.3 million grant from the National Science Foundation in October 2016 to analyze histopathology images and cancer genomics data to yield a mechanistic understanding from gene to phenotypic markers and cancer outcomes. This comprehensive and integrative study of cancer imaging-omics will facilitate the precision medicine research that has cancer treatment as a near-term focus.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The long-term plan for this research is to be able to treat an individual based on his or her image-omics data,&#x201D; Dr. Huang said. &#x201C;For instance, if a patient&#x2019;s tissue images change, how is that related to genomics? Or, how can we use multi-omics to detect mutations? Once we find the biomarkers in the data, we can provide precision medicine strategy to treat the illness, from determining life expectancy to tailoring medicines to an individual&#x2019;s needs.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In related research, Junzhou Huang, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering, earned an $535,763 National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2016 to investigate a process by which image-omics data can be combined into files that are small enough that current computing technology will allow scientists to better predict how long a patient will live and how best to treat that patient.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are pulling together a team that will be able to harness the power of computational modelling alongside real clinical diagnostics, to develop new screening and diagnostics tools and to better monitor treatment and individual patient outcomes,&#x201D; Dimos said.</p>\n<p><b>Screening and Diagnostics</b></p>\n<p>UTA has built up significant expertise in the screening and diagnostics of cancer in clinical settings, including the development of specific biomedical devices that improve early detection of the disease and predictive capacities around cancer metasisis. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Zui Pan, an esophageal cancer biomarker researcher, joined UTA&#x2019;s nursing faculty in 2016 from The Ohio State University College of Medicine. Her work has been funded by a $1.6 million grant from the National Institutes of Health &#x2013; National Cancer Institute and helps develop new screening methods for early detection and prognosis in addition to novel therapeutic drugs for this deadly disease.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My team has identified a protein named Orai1 that is strongly associated with esophageal tumor progression,&#x201D; Dr. Pan said. &#x201C;We plan to evaluate the protein as a potential biomarker for esophageal cancer detection and prognosis with a goal of developing more effective therapeutic interventions for patients suffering from the disease.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b>Non-invasive therapies: important contributions from science and engineering</b></p>\n<p><b>Imaging and Simulation</b></p>\n<p>UTA has focused important efforts in 2016 on strengthening niche areas such as imaging and simulation where its expertise in science and engineering can make a real contribution improving the effectiveness of non-invasive cancer therapies.</p>\n<p>One key success was Baohong Yuan&#x2019;s second large grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas to optimize deep-tissue imaging technology that could allow better monitoring of tumor growth.</p>\n<p>The bioengineering associate professor&#x2019;s original grant focused on the growth of blood vessels in tumors. To grow, a tumor must generate blood vessels for oxygen and nutrients. Dr. Yuan successfully created imaging technology that gave clear images of those blood vessels, which tend to be disorganized.</p>\n<p>With this technology in place, Yuan will now focus on differentiation of cells at the molecular level, including identifying specific biomarkers that may be linked to blood vessel growth.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There are many signal pathways that can lead to blood vessel growth,&#x201D; Yuan said. &#x201C;Researchers have successfully stopped single pathways, but that has not proved successful in the long term. If we can simultaneously stop multiple pathways, it could significantly stop or slow growth and allow more time for treatment, but to do this we must be able to monitor the molecular receptors.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA physicists, led by Mingwu Jin, began working with UT Southwestern and MD Anderson Cancer Center this year on multiple projects sponsored by the National Institutes of Health to develop devices and algorithms to improve the delivery of cancer therapies to patients.</p>\n<p>In one project, the team is working to improve the quality of image-guided radiotherapy techniques that allow for better visualization of tumors, enabling physicians to deliver radiation doses to patients with high precision. In another project, UTA researchers are developing a device that can integrate tumor imaging and photo-induced cancer therapy in a single, portable device. A third project focuses on developing a novel real-time dose-monitoring method for heavy ion therapies.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Jin&#x2019;s work will employ big data analysis and physics models to improve technologies used to deliver cancer therapy and ultimately improve patient care,&#x201D; said UTA Physics Chair Alex Weiss. &#x201C;These collaborations with UT Southwestern and MD Anderson demonstrate clearly the leading role that a scientific research institution like UTA can play to advance knowledge needed by medical institutions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Yuze &#x201C;Alice&#x201D; Sun, an assistant professor of electrical engineering, also earned a $500,000 National Science Foundation CAREER award in 2016 to develop optofluidic lasers to detect biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and other genetic disorders at the molecular and cellular levels.</p>\n<p>Most lasers are semiconductor-based and require solid material to create cavities to confine light. In optofluidic lasers, two-phase liquids are controlled using microfluidics and nanofluidics to form a highly efficient optical microcavity. The all-liquid nature makes the laser adaptive and achieves high-precision tuning in an unprecedented manner, and is uniquely positioned as a novel biosensing technology.</p>\n<p>Dr. Sun said she initially will explore using the optofluidic laser to detect biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and possibly other genetic disorders at the molecular and cellular levels.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This could someday lead to the creation of a point-of-care platform for clinicians to use in an office, rather than having to send samples away for analysis,&#x201D; Sun said.</p>\n<p><b>&#xA0;</b></p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/cancer-particles.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Nanoparticles activated by microwaves to kill cancer</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p><b>Therapeutic Nanoparticles</b></p>\n<p>UTA is also gaining recognition for developing new treatment techniques using therapeutic nanoparticles and nanoseeds to target cancer cells. Nanoparticles and nanoseeds have advantages over traditional therapies, as they can directly target cancer tumors without affecting healthy surrounding tissues.</p>\n<p>One recent success is the work of UTA physicist Wei Chen, who gained international attention in 2016 for research showing that using microwaves to activate photosensitive nanoparticles produces tissue-heating effects and reactive oxygen species that ultimately lead to cell death within solid tumors.</p>\n<p>In prior studies, the researchers had identified a new type of photosensitive nanoparticle, copper-cysteamine or Cu-Cy.&#xA0; They have now demonstrated that the nanoparticle Cu-Cy can also be activated by microwaves, which can be targeted directly at the tumor itself without harming surrounding tissue.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our new microwave-induced photodynamic therapy offers numerous advantages, the most significant of which is increased safety,&#x201D; Dr. Chen said. &#x201C;Our nanoparticle Cu-Cy also demonstrates very low toxicity, is easy to make and inexpensive, and also emits intense luminescence, which means it can also be used as an imaging agent.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b>Mid-term therapies: developing and commercializing new drugs</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UTA researchers are researching and successfully commercializing next-generation cancer therapies, as well as working to improve the performance of drugs that are already in the market and used on a regular basis by cancer patients.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The University recently recruited serial entrepreneur Jon Weidanz as associate vice president for research and professor of biology. His research has focused on immuno-oncology, the emerging field of therapies and treatments aimed at harnessing a patient&#x2019;s immune system to combat cancer.&#xA0; His company AbeXXa Biologics, which recently won an award at an Innovation Day at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is developing next-generation antibody drugs that can target specific proteins on cancer cells. AbeXXa has also signed a significant collaboration agreement with a large pharma company to develop next generation therapeutic agents for cancer immunotherapy.</p>\n<p>Another faculty member developing specific drugs around cancer is UTA chemistry and biochemistry Chair Frederick MacDonnell. He is a co-founder of &#xA0;Tuevol Therapeutics, a company which has exclusively licensed the intellectual property to TS101, a ruthenium-based metallodrug that shows effectiveness against platinum-resistant lung cancer.</p>\n<p>Ruthenium is a rare metallic element and the drugs developed at UTA have many of the therapeutic effects of platinum-based drugs, but without the dehabilitating side effects. Rolf Brekken and Tom Wilkie of the UT Southwestern Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncoclogy are co-founders and are working Dr. MacDonnell to advance this drug to clinical studies.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Further facilitating the translation of our inventions into viable therapies, with investment backing from major pharmaceutical companies, corporate venture capital and angel investors, is an important strategy as we move forward,&#x201D; Dr. Weidanz said. &#x201C;This will allow us to create an innovation hub around cancer that will integrate the University with surrounding businesses and enhance our national and international reputation.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-5\" src=\"/news/images/cancer-trap.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Cancer trap</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p><b>Invasive Therapies: bioengineering devices</b></p>\n<p>In solutions for invasive cancer therapies, Liping Tang&#x2019;s recent work has led to the creation of a cancer trap, a potentially groundbreaking technology for treating metastatic cancer.</p>\n<p>The cancer trap can be implanted under the skin to attract circulating cancer cells by releasing cancer cell-attracting biomolecules.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This research tries to stop the cancer before it spreads,&#x201D; Dr. Tang said. &#x201C;We attract the cancer with these decoys, which are artificial lymph nodes made of biodegradable polymers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Then, when it&#x2019;s trapped, we can use a more targeted radiation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Cancer traps also can be incorporated with chemotherapy drugs or immunotherapy agents to locally eliminate cancer cells with minimal systemic toxicity and have the potential to revolutionize treatment of this disease. His work is currently supported by two three-year grants from the Department of Defense and the Wilson Charitable Foundation Trust.</p>\n<p><b>Post-Operative Treatment: Improving Survival Rates</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UTA is also leading the way in developing therapies to improve the quality of life of cancer patients, both during and after treatment. &#xA0;Over the past two years, the University has made cluster hires in the Department of Kinesiology, bringing to the University a group of experts who can bring their innovative vision to improving the patient experience.&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mark Haykowsky, a professor in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation and Moritz Chair of Geriatric Nursing and Research at UTA, was recently recruited from Alberta&#x2019;s Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, one of the world&#x2019;s preeminent rehabilitation medicine programs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One of his main areas of research is in cardio-oncology, with specific emphasis on the role that exercise training can play to prevent anti-cancer therapy-mediated cardiovascular dysfunction.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This year he launched UTA&#x2019;s FitSteps exercise program, which helps cancer patients increase mobility and boost endurance while undergoing treatment. The program, a partnership with the Cancer Foundation for Life, is structured and tailored to each individual.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A community&#x2019;s greatest asset is a healthy, thriving population,&#x201D; said UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation Dean Anne Bavier. &#x201C;Partnerships of this kind help ensure better survival rates for cancer patients in our community. They also help ensure a better quality of life. Helping tackle such real life problems is a critically important part of our reason for being as a health-focused college and as a university.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA will continue this strong commitment to cancer and to the Texan community going forward, added UTA President Vistasp Karbhari.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The National Cancer Institute reports that approximately 39 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;Progress is being made against the disease, but much work remains. UTA aims to make an important contribution to providing new solutions and treatments to help patients with this disease.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>CANCER Researchers</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Science</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Sen Xu, biology: genetic mutation of cancer cells</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mark Pellegrino, biology: mitochondrial stress signalling</p>\n<p>Clay Clark, biology: programmed cell death</p>\n<p>Jon Weidanz, biology: immunology</p>\n<p>Jonghyun Yun, mathematics, integrative statistical models</p>\n<p>Suvra Pal, mathematics: disease modelling</p>\n<p>Mingwu Jin, physics: devices to improve treatment delivery</p>\n<p>Wei Chen, physics: photosensitive nanoparticles</p>\n<p>Frederick MacDonnell, chemistry and biochemistry: novel chemistries</p>\n<p>Jongyun Heo, chemistry and biochemistry: immune response</p>\n<p><b>&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p><b>Engineering</b></p>\n<p>Baohong Yuan, bioengineering: imaging technologies</p>\n<p>Heng Huang, computer science and engineering: cancer imaging-omics</p>\n<p>Junzhou Huang, computer science and engineering: image-omics</p>\n<p>Samir Iqbal, electrical engineering: cancer detection device</p>\n<p>J.-C.

The Lady Movin&#x2019; Mavs have claimed two national championships.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s start in wheelchair basketball dates back to 1976. Since joining the Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball Division in 1989, 34 UTA Movin&#x2019; Mavs have earned First Team All-American recognition, 28 earned Second Team All-American honors, and nine Movin&#x2019; Mavs have been named MVP.</p>\n<p>Young student athletes from eight countries have studied at UTA and played for the Movin&#x2019; Mavs. More importantly, the graduation rate for the Movin&#x2019; Mavs is extraordinarily high.</p>\n<p>Currently the Movin&apos; Mavs are working to provide additional sport and recreation opportunities for our students with disabilities.&#xA0; See&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/movinmavs/recreation/index.php\">Adaptive Recreation</a>.</p>\n<p>Within the Junior Division, the number of teams tripled from 30 to approximately 90 under his supervision. Garner implemented divisional play among juniors, as well as establishing rules of grade requirements, encouraging young players achieve good grades and graduate high school.</p>\n<p>Garner facilitated skill development by creating camps for juniors, adults and veterans to learn the sport and helped bring the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation classification system to the United States, putting the National Wheelchair Basketball Association in line with other teams and countries in the IWBF, the international governing body for the sport.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Coach Garner works tirelessly to make sure people with disabilities have the same opportunities in life as anyone else,&#x201D; said Alejandro Pabon, a senior on the Movin&#x2019; Mavs team. &#x201C;He gives so much of himself to help make the world a better place for others.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>On the international level, Garner became an International Wheelchair Basketball Federation certified International Technical Official. With this qualification, he was able to establish the criteria to prepare teams for international play.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Doug&#x2019;s passion is contagious,&#x201D; said Lisa&#xA0;Nagy, vice president of student affairs. &#x201C;He is a strong advocate of wheelchair basketball and the opportunities it holds for players.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In the College Division, the Movin&#x2019; Mavs were the first team in the division to livestream their games. Recording both home and away games, Garner was able to archive these games so that friends and family of the players are able to watch them. He also has created training film and posted that on social media to help spread awareness of the sport, as well as young players, coaches and fans around the world could watch the sport.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Doug has been such a huge part of wheelchair sports in general, helping all ages and disabilities,&#x201D; said James Patin III, a Navy veteran and UTA graduate, who now coaches the Dallas Wheelchair Mavericks. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s really amazing when you think about all that he has accomplished, on top of running a successful college wheelchair basketball program.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Garner has created camps and clinics for veterans and other injured soldiers to bring wheelchair basketball back on a more consistent basis that helps those veterans to transition to more of a community team after their military service. He also coached the Army Warrior Games team to three gold medals at the annual event.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I see disability as a growing civil rights movement,&#x201D; Garner said. &#x201C;We have to get past stereotypes and antiquated expectations of disability to an understanding of how our environment&#x2014;including physical, attitude, values and beliefs&#x2014;actually creates the obstacles and road blocks for all people to achieve their full human potential.&#x201D;</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><i>Written by Amanda Augustine</i></p>\n<p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\n"

It&#x2019;s very exciting.&#x201D;</p>\n<div>\n<p>Blanco led the team that senior year in 2010 of senior undergraduate mechanical engineering students. Also on the team were: Christopher Alberts, Kyle Godfrey, Andrew Patin and Chris Grace. Panos Shiakolas, UTA associate professor in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department; and Pranesh Aswath, UTA professor in the Materials Science and Engineering Department and vice provost for academic planning and policy, advised and guided the team.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption250\"><img alt=\"Pranesh Aswath\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/aswath-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Pranesh Aswath, professor and vice provost for academic planning and policy</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>In addition, the team presented its findings through a refereed conference paper at the 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers Winter Annual Meeting conference and at a 2011 Biomedical Engineering Conference.</p>\n<p>More than half a million people in the United States seek medical treatment for burns every year and 40,000 of those have injuries severe enough to require hospitalization.</p>\n<p>In addition to the millions who suffer from burns, Blanco said the project appealed to the team because it had the ability to help soldiers in the field.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption250\"><img alt id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/panos-shaikolas.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Panos&#xA0;Shiakolas, UTA associate professor in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;Many times, soldiers&#x2019; dressings would have to be applied over and over again because health care providers would have to apply medicine,&#x201D; Blanco said. &#x201C;Every time they had to do that, they had to undress and redress the wound. That process of changing the dressings was more dangerous than the technology we designed and developed.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The device the student team designed increases the amount of time between dressing changes in two ways. First, a hydrogel is used to control the wound&#x2019;s temperature and that enables better, controlled drug delivery. Second, the device consists of many separate modules, which are connected by a flexible plastic allowing the bandage to comfortably conform to any wound. A lateral wiring scheme allows for bandage size customizing. Removable medicine trays allow used hydrogel to be removed and the electrical components sterilized, then recharged and reused.</p>\n<p>The team showed in its research that the device could be a profitable product that would reduce infections, ease patient discomfort, shorten hospital stays, lower medical costs and save lives.</p>\n<p>Just for the record, this is Patent No. 9,522,241 and was issued on Dec. 20, 2016. The entry also won the only award given out in 2011for the prestigious American Society for Materials International Undergraduate Design Competition. In addition, the students presented the findings at a 2012 ASME conference.</p>\n<p>Aswath, one of the senior design project&#x2019;s advisers, said the project shows the value of undergraduate research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is just one example of outstanding work done by our undergraduate students who can compete at the highest level and win competitions and get patents awarded,&#x201D; Aswath said. &#x201C;They are all now successful in their careers and we are still in touch with the lead of the team, Letia Blanco, who is a rising star at Raytheon.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Aswath said the patent embodies UTA&#x2019;s theme of health and the human condition within the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">Strategic Plan&#xA0;<i>Bold Solutions | Global Impact</i></a>.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></b></p>\n<p>Shiakolas said the team-based research experience the students received will serve them well in their professional careers.

What that ultimately leads to, though, is trouble at work for both spouses.

The goal is to&#xA0;improve the&#xA0;delivery of&#xA0;housing&#xA0;services,&#xA0;to make them more&#xA0;effective and&#xA0;to ensure they&#x2019;re equitable.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The cities of Dallas, Plano, Garland, McKinney, Denton, Frisco and Irving are part of the study, as well as their respective housing authorities together with the housing authorities of Fort Worth, Dallas County, Greenville, Waxahachie, Cleburne, Ferris, Grandview, Ennis and Royce City.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Fair housing knows no boundaries,&#x201D; Igoufe said. &#x201C;This exploratory project will examine whether inequities and disparities exist. Once we find that out through the data analysis and community consultation, we will then take action.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The analysis phase seeks to identify housing and living patterns of integration and segregation, racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, disproportionate housing needs and disparities in access to opportunity for each entity&#x2019;s area of control. The analysis will rely on data provided by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development-provided as well as local knowledge and data. UTA will update the HUD data to conduct the fair housing analysis.</p>\n<p>UTA also will conduct public meetings and outreach activities designed to encourage and broaden meaningful public participation during the project. UTA has established a website,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.northtexasrha.com\">www.northtexasrha.com</a>, where NAFH-related information can be found.</p>\n<p>Already, the researchers have discovered that agencies&#x2019; have a strong desire to work together to address fair housing across this extremely large region of North Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Seeking solutions from across the region seems appropriate because many of our clients do not provide housing assistance along jurisdictional boundaries,&#x201D; Mattingly said. &#x201C;We want the study to present options for these entities to work together and use the tools identified during the study to establish effective strategies for achieving federal and local goals. We also want to offer advice on how these public-sector entities can work with the private sector to connect the affordable housing sector with livable opportunities in a fair, healthy and vibrant manner.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The interdisciplinary nature of this project complements research being conducted in three University Transportation Centers associated with and led by UTA.

Armstrong has come up with a new, more sensitive test for evidence of performance enhancing drugs.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Daniel W. Armstrong, who holds\nthe UT Arlington Robert A. Welch Chair in Chemistry, and Hongyue Guo, a\ngraduate student in Armstrong&#x2019;s lab, presented the research this week at the\n247<sup>th</sup> National Meeting &amp; Exposition of the American Chemical\nSociety in Dallas. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;How much of a drug someone took or how long\nago they took it are beyond the analyst&#x2019;s control. The only thing you can\ncontrol is how sensitive your method is,&#x201D; Armstrong said. &#x201C;Our goal is to\ndevelop ultra-sensitive methods that will extend the window of detection, and we\nmay have developed one of the most sensitive methods in the world.&#x201D;<b>&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p>According to the\nAmerican Chemical Society, the new strategy is a simple variation on a common\ntesting technique called mass spectrometry, which the International Olympic\nCommittee, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and others routinely use to ensure\nathletes are &#x201C;clean.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mass spectrometry separates\ncompounds by mass, or weight, allowing scientists to determine the component\nparts of a mixture. In the case of performance enhancing drugs, technicians use\nthe method to find the bits left over in blood, urine or other body fluids\nafter the body breaks the substances down.</p>\n<p>Because some of the pieces, or metabolites,\nare small and have a negative charge, they may not produce a signal strong\nenough for the instrument to detect, Armstrong explained &#x2013; especially in the\ncase of stimulants, which the body rapidly eliminates. Stimulants like\namphetamine, or &#x201C;speed,&#x201D; increase alertness and reduce an athlete&#x2019;s sense of\nfatigue.</p>\n<p>The method Armstrong&#x2019;s lab has pioneered is called\npaired ion electrospray ionization (PIESI, pronounced &#x201C;PIE-zee&#x201D;). It gathers several\nof those drug bits together, making them more obvious to the detector. The new\nmethod does not require additional equipment for testing labs, only the\naddition of a chemical the Armstrong team designed which is now commercially\navailable and relatively inexpensive, Guo said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Armstrong&#x2019;s pioneering\nmethods for improving chemical separations have been honored with a long list\nof national and international awards, including his being named a fellow of the\nAmerican Chemical Society,&#x201D; said Carolyn Cason, vice president for research at\nUT Arlington. &#x201C;Equally impressive is his continual quest to apply those\nprincipals to issues that face society and to involve the students he mentors\nin those explorations. This work is an example of the impressive results that\nstem from those endeavors.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The UT Arlington team explained\ntheir research at a news conference in Dallas Wednesday. Video from that event\nis available online at <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/45066065\">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/45066065</a>.</p>\n<p>Armstrong joined UT\nArlington in 2006 and is the author of more than 550 scientific publications,\nincluding 29 book chapters, and holds 23 U.S. and international patents. During\nthis week&#x2019;s conference, he is also being honored with the ACS Award in\nSeparation Science and Technology, which is sponsored by Waters Corp.</p>\n<p>Armstrong\nreceived the ACS Award for Chromatography in 1999 and has also won the 1998<b> </b>ACS\nHelen M.

The honors included a Best-in-Show award for the Academic Faculty\nCategory and a 4<sup>th</sup> place award in the Technology Innovations\ndivision.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our hope is that this project will enhance patient\nsafety and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes,&#x201D; said Beth Mancini, a UT\nArlington nursing professor and Associate Dean of the College of Nursing.\n&#x201C;Being honored by the judges at this year&#x2019;s International Meeting on Simulation\nin Healthcare tells us that the virtual learning environment we&#x2019;ve built is\namong the very best in terms of content and design.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mancini is principal investigator for a nearly $1 million grant from\nthe U.S. Agency for Healthcare and Research Quality that funds GLIMPSE,\nor a &#x201C;Game to Learn Important Communications Methods for Patient Safety\nEnhancement</p>\n<p>Mancini&#x2019;s partners in the research were Baylor\nScott &amp; White Health&#x2019;s Dr. Yan Xiao, director of patient safety research,\nand Susan Houston, director of nursing research at the hospital, as well as\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas&#x2019; Marjorie Zielke.</p>\n<p>Zielke\nis director of the UT Dallas Arts and Technology program&#x2019;s Virtual Humans and\nSynthetic Societies Lab.</p>\n<p>Before the team could build a game for doctors and nurses to play as\npart of the research, they had to recruit actual health care practitioners to\nprovide feedback about positive and negative workplace communications\nexperiences. Xiao said participation by Baylor nurses and physicians was key to\nthat step and hailed the Baylor team as &#x201C;some of the most insightful\ncommunicators for patient safety and optimal patient experience.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Louann Cole, the health services\nresearcher at Baylor who served as the study&#x2019;s project manager, added: &#x201C;I\ncannot stress the importance of our Baylor physicians and nurses and the\nimportant role they had in this game. They were so candid. It was a wonderful\nexperience.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>After the game was built, the\nteam began evaluating doctors and nurses&#x2019; knowledge on effective communication\nstrategies, inviting them to play the game in the role of doctor and the role\nof nurse, and then evaluating participants afterward to see if the game helped\ntheir knowledge. That data gathering is ongoing. </p>\n<p>Organizers of the contest at the\nInternational Meeting on Simulation in Healthcare, which was held in January, compiled\na field of sophisticated competition entries that combined teaching and gaming\ntechnology. Zielke said the contest judges&#x2019; recognition is deeply appreciated. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;The overall track record we\nhave with our game-based simulations and the international recognition we are\nreceiving is very gratifying, particularly when the subject matter is as\nchallenging as it is in GLIMPSE,&#x201D; Zielke said. &#x201C;As always, we owe our\ncontinuing success to the project team and the great faculty, staff, and\nstudents involved in these important research projects.&#xA0; The encouragement and support we get from our\nadministration is also critical.&#x201D; </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About UT Arlington</span></p>\n<p>The\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution and\nthe second largest institution in The University of Texas System.&#xA0;<i>The\nChronicle of Higher Education</i>&#xA0;ranked UT Arlington as the seventh\nfastest-growing public research university in 2013.&#xA0;<i>U.S. News &amp;\nWorld Report</i>&#xA0;ranks UT Arlington fifth in the nation for undergraduate\ndiversity.

Jay Professor in College of Nursing and Health Innovation</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Marco Brotto&#x2014;the George W. and Hazel M. Jay Professor in the college, and an internationally renowned scientist and an expert in bone, muscle physiology and sarcopenia&#x2014;recently obtained renewal for two grants, and funding for three new grants from the National Institutes of Health. These awards will further his work in tackling sarcopenia and osteoporosis, and support his new work on diabetic skeletal muscle disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s disease.</p>\n<p>Sarcopenia, the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength, is prevalent in the aging population and affects 30 to 45 percent of people over the age of 60. It contributes to debilitating injuries, loss of independence, reduced quality of life in the elderly and more than $40 billion in health care costs in the United States alone, according to Brotto. Musculoskeletal diseases affect more than one in two adults and run up health care expenses of about $1 trillion around the world annually, Brotto said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our view of aging is changing as we live longer,&#x201D; said Brotto, who heads the college&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/research/bmrc/index.php\">Bone-Muscle Research Center</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Who would want to live longer and be sick, full of chronic disorders? Aging affects the human musculoskeletal, or MSK, system, causing an array of problems from premature deaths to serious disabilities,&#x201D; Brotto said. &#x201C;Our studies over the next five years aim to advance discovery of how aging leads to osteoporosis, sarcopenia, diabetes, etc. This knowledge will translate into new diagnostics and treatments for MSK disorders and aging decline in MSK function.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Paul Fadel, the college&#x2019;s associate dean for research, said the outcome of Brotto&#x2019;s work could lead to significant living improvements for the elderly and ultimately for all people.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;With 10,000 people turning 65 each day, it is incumbent to seek solutions that further advance health and the quality of life for this population,&#x201D; Fadel said. &#x201C;These studies will help us take gigantic steps in achieving that. As you age, your risk for falls increases because you&#x2019;re losing strength and balance. And this increases your risk for fractures, which can be very debilitating. Dr. Brotto and his team are tackling these problems from a variety of important angles.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Merwin, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, said, &#x201C;These grants are a boon for the college, for UTA and for health care. These studies are potentially transformative. The outcome of the work of Dr. Brotto and his team of fellow researchers could significantly enhance the quality of life of the elderly.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Following are snapshots of the five NIH grants:</p>\n<p><b>Bone-Muscle Crosstalk: bone cells regulation of skeletal muscle function&#x2014;</b>This grant is part of a special NIH mechanism called Program Project Grant, or PPG, involving four principal Investigators, or PIs, at Indiana University, the University of Missouri-Kansas City and UTA. Brotto is the PI of Project 2 of this PPG. He will use this $1.89 million grant to determine how bone cells can influence and change the function of muscles by releasing hormone-like molecules. Brotto has discovered that this process is altered with aging.</p>\n<p><b>Regulation of store-operated calcium entry during muscle aging</b>:&#x2014;Brotto will use this $1.97 million grant to examine the mechanisms that contribute to the loss of strength in muscle during aging and determine if regulating certain proteins can improve the function of aged skeletal muscles. He is collaborating with Professor Noah Weisleder at Ohio State University.</p>\n<p><b>Loss of a protein in muscle dysfunction in aging</b>&#x2014;With this $1 million grant, Brotto and his team will work with Christopher Cardozo, a professor at the Icahn School of School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, to investigate the role of a protein called &#x201C;numb&#x201D; in muscle function and weakness with aging. He believes the knowledge is likely to increase understanding of the causes of muscle weakness. &#x201C;It could lead to treatments to prevent and mitigate weakness and frailty in the elderly,&#x201D; Brotto said.</p>\n<p><b>Protecting the diabetic skeletal muscle by Nampt activation</b>&#x2014;The major objective of this $965,000 grant is to develop Nampt, or protein gene activators, to protect skeletal muscles from diabetes. &#x201C;Diabetes is a metabolic disease associated with skeletal muscle injury,&#x201D; Brotto said. &#x201C;This research project will generate high-impact pharmacological data through the discovery of new agents and develop molecular insights into preventing muscle injury in diabetes.&#x201D; Brotto is collaborating with Srinivas Tipparaju, an associate professor in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of South Florida.</p>\n<p><b>Alleviating the progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS</b>&#x2014;Research shows that muscles appear to be primary targets as the ALS gene mutates. This is the primary research topic of Jingsong Zhou, UTA professor of kinesiology and associate director of the Bone-Muscle Research Center. In collaboration with the Zhou team, Brotto and his team plan to use this $750,000 grant to develop alternative therapeutic strategies for combatting ALS.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Lekan&#xA0;Oguntoyinbo</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>\n"

Chiao designed and built the device that is about 1.8 mm at its widest point. A single grain of rice could hold about 10 of these tiny windmills. Hundreds of the windmills could be embedded in a sleeve for a cell phone. Wind, created by waving the cell phone in air or holding it up to an open window on a windy day, would generate the electricity that could be collected by the cell phone&#x2019;s battery.</p>\n<p>Rao&#x2019;s works in micro-robotic devices initially heightened a Taiwanese company&#x2019;s interest in having Rao and Chiao brainstorm over novel device designs and applications for the company&#x2019;s unique fabrication techniques, which are known in the semiconductor industry for their reliability.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Smitha Rao\" src=\"/news/images/smitharao.jpeg\" width=\"300\"><figcaption>UT Arlington Research Associate Smitha Rao</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;The company was quite surprised with the micro-windmill idea when we showed the demo video of working devices,&#x201D; Rao said. &#x201C;It was something completely out of the blue for them and their investors.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Rao&#x2019;s designs blend origami concepts into conventional wafer-scale semiconductor device layouts so complex 3-D moveable mechanical structures can be self-assembled from two-dimensional metal pieces utilizing planar multilayer electroplating techniques that have been optimized by WinMEMS Technologies Co., the Taiwanese fabrication foundry that took an initial interest in Rao&#x2019;s work.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The micro-windmills work well because the metal alloy is flexible and Smitha&#x2019;s design follows minimalism for functionality.&#x201D; Chiao said.</p>\n<p>WinMEMS became interested in the micro-electro mechanical system research and started a relationship with UT Arlington. Company representatives visited with the UT Arlington team several times in 2013 to discuss collaboration.</p>\n<p>An agreement has been established for UT Arlington to hold the intellectual properties while WinMEMS explores the commercialization opportunities. UT Arlington has applied for a provisional patent.</p>\n<p>Currently, WinMEMS has been showcasing UT Arlington&#x2019;s works on its <a href=\"http://www.winmemstech.com/en/page/custom68/\">website</a> and in public presentations, which include the micro-windmills, gears, inductors, pop-up switches and grippers. All of those parts are as tiny as a fraction of the diameter of a human hair.</p>\n<p>These inventions are essential to build micro-robots that can be used as surgical tools, sensing machines to explore disaster zones or manufacturing tools to assemble micro-machines.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s very gratifying to first be noticed by an international company and second to work on something like this where you can see immediately how it might be used,&#x201D; said Rao, who earned her Ph.D in 2009 at UT Arlington. &#x201C;However, I think we&#x2019;ve only scratched the surface on how these micro-windmills might be used.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The micro windmills were tested successfully in September 2013 in Chiao&#x2019;s lab. The windmills operate under strong artificial winds without any fracture in the material because of the durable nickel alloy and smart aerodynamic design.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The problem most MEMS designers have is that materials are too brittle,&#x201D; Rao said. &#x201C;With the nickel alloy, we don&#x2019;t have that same issue. They&#x2019;re very, very durable.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The micro-windmills can be made in an array using the batch processes. The fabrication cost of making one device is the same as making hundreds or thousands on a single wafer, which enables for mass production of very inexpensive systems.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Imagine that they can be cheaply made on the surfaces of portable electronics,&#x201D; Chiao said, &#x201C;so you can place them on a sleeve for your smart phone. When the phone is out of battery power, all you need to do is to put on the sleeve, wave the phone in the air for a few minutes and you can use the phone again.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Chiao said because of the small sizes, flat panels with thousand of windmills could be made and mounted on the walls of houses or building to harvest energy for lighting, security or environmental sensing and wireless communication.</p>\n<p>He added that it has been fulfilling to see his former student succeed and help move innovation toward the marketplace.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;To see a company recognize that and seek you out for your expertise speaks volumes about what UT Arlington means to the world,&#x201D; he said proudly.</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution of more than 33,300 students and 2,300 faculty members in the epicenter of North Texas. It is the second largest institution in the University of Texas System. Research expenditures reached almost $78 million last year.

The research is funded through NASA&#x2019;s Living With a Star\ninitiative, which supports physics to further knowledge about the sun, its\nrelationship to the Earth and its effect on life and society.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Almost all the influence of\nspace weather on our society is affected by dynamics in the upper atmosphere. Neutral\nwind in the upper atmosphere is very difficult to model and measure but it is\nstill one of the most important parameters to consider,&#x201D; said Deng, an\nassistant professor of physics who joined UT Arlington&#x2019;s College of Science in\n2009.</p>\n<p>Solar winds (plasma) from the\nSun carry an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and energy that interacts with\nthe Earth&#x2019;s outer magnetic field, or magnetosphere. During times of greater\nsolar output, like after a coronal mass ejection (CME) or solar flare, spikes\nof energy can enter the thermosphere/ionosphere, also known as the upper\natmosphere.

        "body": "\n<p>A\nnew study by UT Arlington researchers could lead to better language assessments\nand timelier treatment for children with language learning difficulties.</p>\n<p>Jodi\nTommerdahl, an associate professor of curriculum and instruction in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/coehp/index.php\">College\nof Education and Health Professions</a>,\nand Cynthia Kilpatrick, an assistant professor of linguistics in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/libarts/index.html\">College\nof Liberal Arts</a>, found that language concerns among children\ncould be reliably diagnosed by analyzing samples about 100 spoken words at a\ntime rather than evaluating longer samples that take more time to analyze. The\nteam argues that the shorter samples could speed up the diagnosis process and\nenable clinicians help children earlier in life.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is key because at the moment, language impairment is often\nundiagnosed. And when it is diagnosed, it&#x2019;s diagnosed later\nthan you&#x2019;d want it to be,&#x201D; Tommerdahl said.</p>\n<p>She added: &#x201C;If we can find meaningful differences in typical and atypical\nlanguage in children at age 2 instead of at age 6, we&#x2019;re just that much closer\nto developing more appropriate treatments for those kids and getting them back\non track both in the linguistic sense, but also educationally.&#x201D; The new findings are published in this month&#x2019;s journal <i>Language Testing.</i> &#xA0;</p>\n<p>For\ntheir study, the pair used a test-retest procedure to look systematically at\nthe morphology and syntax ability in 23 typically developing children between\nages 2 and 3. They set up toys, hidden cameras and microphones in a flexible, large\nroom at the University of Birmingham, U.K., which provided some funding for the\nstudy. As\neach child and parent entered the room, their interactions were recorded for\n40-minute intervals over several days within a one-week period.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>&#x201C;We\nhad very good quality in a natural play setting because most of what we know about\nchild language comes from spontaneous samples or observing children communicate\nnaturally,&#x201D; Tommerdahl said. &#x201C;Most tests involve elicited language or children\nbeing asked to do something or to respond to specific stimuli.&quot; </p>\n<p>Some researchers\nrecord in a clinic with a professional interacting with the child. The team says that using spontaneous samples, however, the children are not in a test\nsituation, not nervous, and researchers are able to see real-life language that\nchildren use on a daily basis.\n</p>\n<p>Kilpatrick said their research shows that 200 utterances is not better\nthan 100 utterances in terms of reliability within a spontaneous language\nsample, so 100 utterances might be the ultimate sample size.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Clinicians, linguists and people who work with\nlanguage samples spend a lot of time recording language samples, and you want\nthe shortest sample possible to give you the best results or most reliable\nresult that you can get,&#x201D; Kilpatrick said. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>The team&#x2019;s next step is to acquire funding to either\ndevelop or contribute to an enormous database of child language that would be\nfreely available to researchers who want to use it.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Tommerdahl and Kilpatrick&#x2019;s new paper is called &#x201C;<a href=\"http://ltj.sagepub.com/content/31/1/3.abstract\">The\nReliability of Morphological Analyses in Language Samples</a>.&#x201D; It is also available via <a href=\"http://languagetesting.info/sage/ltb.php\">podcast</a> at the <i>Language Testing</i>\nwebsite.</p>\n<p>\n<b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About UT Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a\ncomprehensive research institution and the second largest institution in The\nUniversity of Texas System.

HOTAIR is an abbreviation\nfor long, non-coding RNA, a part of DNA in humans and other vertebrates. HOTAIR\ndoes not produce a protein on its own but, when it is being expressed or\nfunctioning, it can suppress genes that would normally slow tumor growth or cause\ncancer cell death. </p>\n<p>High levels of HOTAIR expression\nhave been linked to breast tumors, pancreatic and colorectal cancers, sarcoma\nand others.</p>\n<p>UT Arlington researchers found\nthat when breast cancer and mammary gland cells were exposed to BPA in lab\ntests, the BPA worked together with naturally present molecules, including\nestrogen, to create abnormal amounts of HOTAIR expression. Their results were\npublished online in February by the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and\nMolecular Biology. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t immediately say BPA\ncauses cancer growth, but it could well contribute because it is disrupting the\ngenes that defend against that growth,&#x201D; said Mandal, who is corresponding\nauthor on the paper. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Understanding the developmental\nimpact of these synthetic hormones is an important way to protect ourselves and\ncould be important for treatment,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>Bhan is lead author on the new\npaper. Co-authors include Mandal lab members Imran Hussain and Khairul I\nAnsari, as well as Linda I. Perrotti, a UT Arlington psychology assistant\nprofessor, and Samara A.M. Bobzean, a member of Perrotti&#x2019;s lab.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We were surprised to find that BPA\nnot only increased HOTAIR in tumor cells but also in normal breast tissue,&#x201D;\nsaid Bhan. He said further research is needed, but the results beg the question\n&#x2013; are BPA and HOTAIR involved in tumor genesis in addition to tumor growth?</p>\n<p>BPA has been widely used in\nplastics, such as food storage containers, the lining of canned goods and,\nuntil recently, baby bottles. It belongs to a class of endocrine disrupting\nchemicals, or EDCs, which have been shown to mimic natural hormones. These\nendocrine disruptors interfere with hormone regulation and proper function of human\ncells, glands and tissue. Previous studies have linked BPA to problems with\nreproductive development, early puberty, obesity and cancers.</p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances,\nestrogen regulates HOTAIR, turning its expression on and off through\ninteraction with molecules called estrogen-receptors, or ERs, and estrogen\nreceptor-coregulators, or ER-coregulators. The new study found that BPA\ndisrupts the normal function of the ERs and the ER-coregulators when estrogen\nwas present and when it wasn&#x2019;t, potentially implicating it in tumor growth in a\nvariety of cancers. </p>\n<p>&quot;Research\nwork is at its best when results can shed light on issues of public concern.\nDr. Mandal and his team are using their expertise to do just that.

Armstrong, UT Arlington&#x2019;s Robert A. Welch Chair in Chemistry, says the new technique could be 100 times more sensitive than one of the most popular current methods.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The analysis for water in many consumer products, including drugs, is one of the most required tests done in the world,&#x201D; said Armstrong. &#x201C;Current methods have many shortcomings, including poor sensitivity and reproducibility; they cannot be used for all products and they can be time consuming. &#xA0;I believe our new &#x2018;ionic liquid&#x2019; method offers improvements in all these areas.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Armstrong and two graduate students recently wrote about their new research in a paper that will be in the June issue of the <i>Journal of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Analysis</i>. The publication describes using headspace gas chromatography and an ionic liquid gas chromatography column Armstrong&#x2019;s lab developed to measure moisture content in active pharmaceutical ingredients such as ibuprofen, tetracycline and ephedrine. Water content can affect the stability and shelf life of a drug and, when it is too high, cause microbial growth, according to the paper.</p>\n<p>Chromatography is the process of separating a chemical mixture to measure its components. Headspace gas chromatography, or HSGC, involves the measuring of volatile analytes, or chemical components, as they diffuse into a &#x201C;headspace&#x201D; at the top of a tube of sample, including solids. The new method combines HSGC with the use of ionic liquids. Ionic liquids consist of a mixture of positively and negatively charged molecules. They have a variety of advantages as solvents.</p>\n<p>Currently, two methods are most commonly used to measure moisture content. One is called weight loss on drying, or LOD; the other is called Karl Fischer Titration, or KFT. The newly described work from Armstrong&#x2019;s lab is useful on more types of drug ingredients than LOD and is more than 100 times more sensitive in some cases than KFT. It also can be used for much smaller samples and be automated, the paper said.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Graduate student Lillian A. Frink is lead author on the paper and Choyce A. Weatherly, also a graduate student in Armstong&#x2019;s lab, is a co-author.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We think industry will utilize this method based on its broad applicability, its high accuracy, and the sample size requirements,&#x201D; said Frink. &#x201C;It also doesn&#x2019;t have side-reactions like current methods, which make them inaccurate.&quot;</p>\n<p>Armstrong has been a leader in the characterizing and synthesizing ionic liquids. He also holds patents on several open tubular capillary gas chromatography columns that utilize ionic liquids, including those used in the current research.</p>\n<p>The newly published paper is called &#x201C;Water determination in active pharmaceutical ingredients using ionic liquid headspace gas chromatography and two different detection protocols.&#x201D; It is available here: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561336\">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561336.</a></p>\n<p>Armstrong joined UT Arlington in 2006 and is the author of more than 550 scientific publications, including 29 book chapters, and holds 23 U.S. and international patents.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>His lab recently made headlines when they debuted research on a new method for testing for performance enhancing drugs. That research, which was presented at the 247<sup>th</sup> National Meeting &amp; Exposition of the American Chemical Society, showed that their protocol could be up to 1,000 more sensitive than many current tests.

He is developing a mass spectrometry-based chemical cross-linking technology that will provide information on large-scale protein signaling networks in their natural biological conditions.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Proteins reside inside and outside of the cells, and when we open the cells, most of the interaction information that can help us to better understand disease processes gets lost,&#x201D; Chowdhury said. &#x201C;Current biochemical methods are not very efficient to analyze system-level or large-scale protein interaction networks. Through innovative analytical techniques, and by chemical cross-linking of proteins before cell analysis, we can overcome current limitations.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Chowdhury will conduct his studies at UT Arlington&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/sirt/scaac/\">Shimadzu Center for Advanced Analytical Chemistry</a>, which has several high-performance mass spectrometers. He will also utilize a new mass spectrometer with advance protein sequencing features being installed in his laboratory soon.</p>\n<p>A mass spectrometer is an instrument that can identify protein or peptide (small pieces of protein) sequences by fragmenting them into small pieces and analyzing their masses. Chowdhury&#x2019;s lab is developing crosslinkers, which contain a specific mass that will be released during mass spectrometry analysis.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is like a mass barcode in this probe, which will help to find protein interaction sites from millions of mass spectrometry data,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;This will enable us to find the specific fragment markers in the mass spectrometry data so cross-linked proteins can be identified clearly in a high-throughput automated manner.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The goal will be to develop a mass spectrometry-based chemical cross-linking technology to help recognize protein-to-protein interactions unambiguously and reduce data complexity of large-scale studies. His laboratory is also developing associated software tools for the research with the help of UT Arlington computer science students.</p>\n<p>Chowdhury added that the anticipated application of the technology will be to identify the protein signaling networks involved in environmental diseases, such as sepsis and asthma, as well as cancer. The research will help scientists find new drugs targeted to disrupt protein interaction networks in the disease processes.</p>\n<p>James Grover, interim dean of the UT Arlington College of Science, called Chowdhury&#x2019;s project, &#x201C;a wonderful example of the innovative work that is being done in UT Arlington&#x2019;s world-class facilities.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In January, Chowdhury received a $391,000 grant from The University of Texas System Board of Regents to purchase a new mass spectrometer. The equipment will be used by him as part of a UT System-wide Proteomics Core Facility Network that arises from several UT campuses, including UT Arlington.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The main objective of the network is to make available high quality proteomics technologies and expertise to all researchers and trainees across UT System&#x2019;s nine universities and six health institutions,&#x201D; UT System Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation Patricia D. Hurn said in a statement.</p>\n<p>The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, which was awarded $5.7 million for the <a href=\"https://blogs.utmb.edu/thought-you-should-know/2014/10/24/utmb-awarded-5-7-million-to-develop-ut-system-proteomics-core-facility-network/\">initiative</a>, will direct administrative functions of the network. Other participating institutions include UT Austin, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, UT Health Northeast (formerly UT Health Science Center at Tyler), UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and UT Health Science Center at San Antonio.</p>\n<p>In addition to the NIH and UT System grants, Chowdhury&#x2019;s group recently detailed a novel proteomics technology that analyzes lipid modification in proteins. Their study, &#x201C;Mass Spectrometry Cleavable Strategy for Identification and Differentiation of Prenylated Peptides,&#x201D; is published in the current journal <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac503794s\">Analytical Chemistry</a>.</p>\n<p>The modifications, which are called prenylation, attach lipid side-chains in the proteins. They have been associated with 90 percent of pancreatic and colon cancers as well as progeria, a genetic disease that causes the premature aging of children.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Most clinical trials to block this change in a widely known cancer-causing protein did not work,&#x201D; Chowdhury said. &#x201C;Due to the absence of effective methods, large-scale identification of proteins that contained this modification was not possible in native biological conditions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The method that Chowdhury&#x2019;s group reported not only identified the modification sites, but can also distinguish the variation of the modification in a single experimental set-up by mass spectrometry technology. Chowdhury thinks the method will significantly contribute to advancing the understanding of cancer mechanism, its treatment and diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Ruchika Bhawal, a graduate student of Chowdhury&#x2019;s laboratory, is the first author on the study. It can be found at <a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac503794s\">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ac503794s</a>. <b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></b></p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution of almost 48,000 students around the world and the second largest institution in The University of Texas System.

In fact, the comic books were at one point, more widely read in Mexico than any other form of print.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In addition to inspiring national pride and entertaining its millions of readers, comic books promoted literacy.</p>\n<p>Conway said Mexico&#x2019;s government sponsored literacy campaigns in the 1930s and comics helped the less affluent learn to read.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Comics were something that the rich and poor could afford,&#x201D; Conway said. &#x201C;But, it enabled poor people to exercise their reading skills and made them feel as if they were becoming more modern and educated.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>All of the comic books and a few movie posters in the exhibit are from Conway&#x2019;s own collection. He began gathering the memorabilia as a graduate student studying Spanish. The comic books in the exhibit include depictions of world figures such as John F.

Some cover subjects include immigration, race, triumphs and tragedies that have defined modern Mexico.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption250\"><img alt src=\"/news/images/chris-conway.jpeg\" width=\"250\"><figcaption>Chris Conway</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Another aspect of the exhibit will accent women important to Mexican history, such as La Malinche, Sor Juana In&#xE9;s de la Cruz and Virgen de <em>Guadalupe</em>.</p>\n<p>Christian Zlolniski, associate professor of sociology and anthropology and director of the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/cmas/index.html\">UT Arlington Center for Mexican American Studies</a>, underscored the significant role that comic books hold in Mexico&#x2019;s history.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Few people know the history of Mexican comics. They reached a massive audience and had a deep cultural impact in Mexico. Yet their significance has been largely ignored because comic books have not been historically viewed as culturally valuable in comparison to other cultural productions such as literature or movies,&#x201D; Zlolniski said. &#x201C;This exhibit will help to correct that bias and showcase the important role comics have traditionally played in Mexico&#x2019;s popular culture.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Parts of the exhibit are interactive and will be presented in both Spanish and English.

She wanted to track their progress when they wrote and exchanged letters with relatives such as a grandparent, aunt or other extended family member.</p>\n<p>The study, called &#x201C;Why Downt You Riyt Back to Me?&#x201D; appears in <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trtr.1364/abstract\"><i>The Reading Teacher</i></a>, a journal of the International Literacy Association.</p>\n<p>When Pole&#x2019;s group first started the year, the 5- and 6-year-olds rarely moved past predictable statements, such as &#x201C;<i>I like&#x2026;</i>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<i>I</i> <i>saw&#x2026;</i>&#x201D; followed by a word or two.</p>\n<p>By the third round of letters, the 13 girls and 9 boys were planning what they were going to write in their next letters. The kindergarteners also had plans for other writing, because now, they considered themselves to be writers. By the end of the year, the students&#x2019; letters were longer, contained more than one idea and provided a context for family history.</p>\n<p>When new correspondence arrived, and with the adults&#x2019; permission, the children had the choice of letting Pole read the letter aloud to the class; having it read to the child; or not having it read aloud at all.

She said Pole&#x2019;s study is important because of its emphasis on early childhood education.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Research like this is invaluable as it takes into consideration the very people who help to shape a 5 or 6-year-old child&#x2019;s early academic and life lessons &#x2013; school educators and family members,&#x201D; said Rep. Giddings. &#x201C;Learning to read and write at such a young level is vital to the long-term education outcomes for our state and nation. These lessons also provide unique experiences for the teachers themselves.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Jeanne Gerlach, dean of the UTA <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/coed/index.php\">College of Education</a>, called Pole&#x2019;s work a tremendous resource aligned with the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020</a>: Bold Solutions | Global Impact. The plan sets a path to unprecedented University excellence in research, teaching and community engagement.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/pole-letter-writingpic2jpeg.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Courtesy K. Pole</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Dr. Pole has examined the ways in which family letter writing can be used to support early literacy, and demonstrates the impact of teacher action research,&#x201D; Gerlach said. &#x201C;This type of advocacy is inspiring students to become better readers, writers and communicators. It&#x2019;s also motivating current and future teachers to connect with students utilizing meaningful and creative pedagogies.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The unidentified school in Pole&#x2019;s study is located in a small, southwestern U.S. city. The school served about 600 students from pre-K through fifth grade and received Title 1 funding. About 45 percent of the students are classified as economically disadvantaged and the school was recognized by the state as having exemplary student achievement ratings. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>For the study, the kindergarten students and their extended family members lived far enough away that they didn&#x2019;t visit often and were able to correspond for a school year.</p>\n<p>Adult participants committed 3 to 10 hours writing their letters, but they had the option to commit as much or as little time as they wished. They were asked to use natural language to tell family stories in their letters. The kindergarten students did most of their writing in class as it was woven into assignments and class activities</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I chose to use a paper-based form of writing rather than e-mail because at the start, some of the children were still drawing images as placeholders for words, and because their pictures sometimes carried more meaning than the words they could write,&#x201D; Pole said. &#x201C;We looked for opportunities to write. On a day when the cafeteria served especially delicious cookies, we wrote a class letter thanking the cooks. We were always writing.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Pole said her study demonstrates that when children have an audience and purpose for writing their writing improves, their ability and motivation to spell and write legibly improves and that family letter writing helps develop stronger family bonds. Pole is planning follow-up studies to see if the correspondence project is replicable in different sites and contexts.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About the UTA College of Education</span></b></p>\n<p>The UTA College of Education is fully accredited through the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and in 2006 became the first College of Education within the UT System to receive accreditation through the prestigious National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education.

Nygren will accept the award May 25 during the 13th Pisa Meeting on Advanced Detectors at Elba Island, Italy. Italian physicist Fabio Sauli was named a 2015 co-recipient of the award. The prize consists of a cash award and a silver plate citing the recipient&#x2019;s contributions.</p>\n<p>UT Arlington President Vistasp Karbhari commended Nygren and said the international recognition heightens awareness of faculty excellence at UT Arlington and in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/cos/\">College of Science</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Nygren&#x2019;s selection as the co-recipient of the Aldo Menzione Prize is a well-deserved achievement,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;The honor represents the highest level of recognition for his work by the leading researchers in the world of physics. We are proud of the tremendous work that he and colleagues in the Department of Physics are doing to elevate scholarship and research at UT Arlington.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nygren, a renowned expert in particle physics, developed the Time Projection Chamber in 1974 to enable accurate and complete capture of the outcome of a collision of a very high energy particle with other particles in a colliding beam experiment. These collisions can lead to the production of hundreds or even thousands of new particles created in the collision.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In a real sense, the TPC idea allowed three-dimensional images to be reconstructed for such complex events for the first time,&#x201D; Nygren said. &#x201C;Since its origin, the TPC idea has evolved to include many other applications in physics such as the search for very rare events. One example would be a collision of a heavy Dark Matter particle with ordinary matter. Forty years after invention, it is rare indeed for a technique to display such adaptive powers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nygren joined the UT Arlington <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/physics/\">Department of Physics</a> in August 2014. He previously worked at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for more than 30 years. While there, he was promoted to Distinguished Scientist in 1995 because of his invention of the TPC and innovations in charge-coupled devices used in digital imaging as well as medical imaging and pixel arrays. Nygren earned his Ph.D. at the University of Washington in 1967 and is a fellow of the American Physical Society.</p>\n<p>Among the many distinguished awards he has received, are the Berkeley Lab Prize - Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013; the Panofsky Prize in Experimental Particle Physics from the American Physical Society in 1998; and the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award from the Department of Energy in 1985. He was named a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2000.</p>\n<p>Aldo Menzione was a renowned physicist and a pioneer in the development and use of silicon vertex detectors. He was a co-recipient of the Panofsky Prize in 2009.

With UTA&#x2019;s advanced bioreactor, the Denton landfill system now generates enough methane gas to power 5,000 homes monthly.</p>\n<p>Vance Kemler, Denton&#x2019;s general manager of solid waste operations, said the collaboration with UTA is attracting attention across North Texas and beyond.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Those landfill and environmental officials are discovering that landfills are resources, not just expenses,&#x201D; Kemler said. &#x201C;This latest research will show that mining could be productive to cities. What&#x2019;s recyclable or not has changed since some of this refuse has been buried. Dr. Hossain will show if those materials can be used for additional energy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In addition to Denton, representatives from Irving and Grand Prairie have joined the Solid Waste Institute for Sustainability&#x2019;s advisory board as have researchers and officials from Brazil, Japan, Portugal, Thailand, Turkey, Serbia and the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the UTA College of Engineering, said Dr. Hossain&#x2019;s work exemplifies the global environmental impact envisioned in <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020 | Bold Solutions: Global Impact.</a></p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Hossain is advancing both our understanding of how to extend the lifespan of landfills and how to capitalize on them as an alternative energy source,&#x201D; Behbehani said. &#x201C;This is truly exciting research in a living laboratory with the potential to increase sustainability in a critical sector worldwide. And this work has the potential to provide energy to parts of the world with limited resources.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About the Solid Waste Institute for Sustainability</span></b></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/swis/\">UTA Solid Waste Institute for Sustainability</a> combines science, engineering and social science expertise in developing new methodologies and solutions to explore international paths to sustainable waste management.

        "body": "\n<p>NASA has selected UT Arlington as one of four U.S. institutions to develop improved methods for oxygen recovery and reuse aboard human spacecraft, a technology the agency says is crucial to &#x201C;enable our human journey to Mars and beyond.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Krishnan Rajeshwar, Brian Dennis, Norma Tacconi\" src=\"/news/images/nasa-project-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"350\"><figcaption>The UT Arlington team researching ways to increase oxygen recovery rates are from left: Krishnan Rajeshwar, distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry in the College of Science;&#xA0;Brian Dennis, associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering in the College of Engineering; and Norma Tacconi, a research associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>NASA&#x2019;s Game Changing Development Program awarded $513,356 recently to the UT Arlington team. UT Arlington and three other teams are charged with the goal of increasing oxygen recovery to 75 percent or more.</p>\n<p>Principal investigators on the UT Arlington project are Brian Dennis, associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering in the College of Engineering; Krishnan Rajeshwar, distinguished professor of chemistry and biochemistry in the College of Science; and Norma Tacconi, a research associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>\n<p>They will design, build and demonstrate a &#x201C;microfluidic electrochemical reactor&#x201D; to recover oxygen from carbon dioxide that is extracted from cabin air. The prototype will be built over the next year at the Center for Renewable Energy Science and Technology, CREST, at UT Arlington.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;At the end of this 15 month Phase I project, we will demonstrate the prototype to NASA officials. If we are selected to move to Phase II, we plan to build a full-scale unit. We hope the technology will be flight tested on the International Space Station sometime in the future,&#x201D; Dennis said. &#x201C;That&apos;s what we&apos;re really excited about and what we&apos;ll be aiming for.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dennis said the design uses water and carbon dioxide as reactants and produces oxygen and hydrocarbon gases, such as methane. The gases can be vented into space and the oxygen is used for breathing.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We have developed a nanocomposite electrode that speeds oxygen evolution at lower potential. That basically means it can produce more oxygen in a shorter time with less power and less reactor volume,&#x201D; said Dennis. &#x201C;This is important since power on a spacecraft is limited because it comes from solar panels and spacecraft capacity also is limited. Things should be as compact and lightweight as possible.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Current methods of oxygen recovery used on the International Space Station, or ISS, achieve only about a 50 percent recovery rate. A better recovery rate means less oxygen needs to be stored and would free up precious cargo space on prolonged missions. With current technology, a trip to Mars would take about eight months, though scientists are working to shorten that time.</p>\n<p>In a statement from NASA, Associate Administrator for Space Technology Michael Gazarak said improving oxygen recovery and designing a system with high reliability is crucial to long-duration human spaceflight.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These ambitious projects will enable the critical life support systems needed for us to venture further into space and explore the high frontier and are another example of how technology drives exploration,&quot; Gazarak said. NASA&#x2019;s full announcement is available here: <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/october/nasa-selects-advanced-oxygen-recovery-proposals-for-spacecraft-missions/#.VDV8RedDRgh\">http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/october/nasa-selects-advanced-oxygen-recovery-proposals-for-spacecraft-missions/#.VDV8RedDRgh</a>.</p>\n<p>Dennis said the proposed UT Arlington device has an advantage over the ISS method because not as much water is needed to achieve 75 percent recovery. The team estimates its system would require less water than what can be recovered in one day from a person&#x2019;s sweat and urine. A water recovery system that converts bodily fluids to water is already at work on the ISS.</p>\n<p>For years, Dennis, Rajeshwar and Tacconi have developed novel nanocomposites to be used in targeted electrochemical reactions for fuel cells and other purposes. The new project builds on that work and is another demonstration of the key role electrochemistry can play in technological advances, Tacconi and Rajeshwar said.</p>\n<p>James Grover, interim dean of the UT Arlington College of Science, said the new NASA-funded project is a great chance for the College of Science and College of Engineering to make an impact in a field that captures human imagination and inspires innovation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Discoveries are cultivated through interdisciplinary collaboration and UT Arlington scientists and engineers have embraced that spirit to achieve advances,&#x201D; Grover said.</p>\n<p>Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the College of Engineering, said the interdisciplinary project speaks to practical aspects of space research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This project has great implication for space explorations,&#x201D; Behbehani said. &#x201C;Through collaboration of scientists and engineers at UT Arlington such innovations have become possible which can put us closer to exploring farther destinations in space.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution of more than 48,000 students around the world and the second largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Between 1,500 and 2,000 cases of such injuries are reported in the U.S. each year.</p>\n<p>Researchers at The University of Texas at Arlington and The University of Texas at Austin are developing a solution in the form of what are believed to be the first formal protocols for effective and safe use of cold therapy, and a state-of-the-art cryotherapy device that can stimulate blood flow to keep tissue healthy and minimize potential side effects.</p>\n\n<p>Matthew Brothers, an associate professor of <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/kinesiology/\">kinesiology</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/nursing/\">UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation,</a> is co-investigator on the project. The work is supported by a four-year, $1.1 million grant from the National Institutes of Health. Brothers and his co-investigator Kenneth Diller, a University of Texas at Austin professor of biomedical engineering, alongside other colleagues, have filed a provisional patent application for the innovative technology that will result from their work. The team may secure additional funding as they achieve results.</p>\n<p>Currently, about 800 Austin area patients are participating in the formal testing process. Recruitment in the Arlington area is scheduled to begin in February.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Preliminary research has shown that a 30-minute cryotherapy session causes an approximate 90 percent reduction in blood flow to the treated area, which continues for up to three hours after the treatment is over and skin temperatures have returned to the pre-cooling levels.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This pronounced and sustained reduction in blood flow, which lowers the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the treated area, contributes to these side-effects,&#x201D; said Brothers, who joined UTA in 2015. &#x201C;Our research will establish the optimal times and temperatures for treatment and test ways to stimulate blood flow to the treatment area. We will also develop new devices that apply cold directly to the treatment site to increase the precision of care.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Currently, without formal protocols, extreme practitioners can advocate continuous use of cryotherapy for days and even weeks while others recommend an application period of 20 to 30 minutes followed by a cessation period of two hours.</p>\n<p>In addition to developing protocols and a prototype device, the team also is investigating the physiological mechanisms behind the reductions in blood flow, through a series of experiments that involve infusing different substances that impact the regulation of blood vessels. These substances range from antioxidants to ones that block the response of sympathetic nerves that cause vasoconstriction. Changes in blood circulation are then measured using a laser Doppler probe to determine the reasons behind the reductions in blood flow.</p>\n<p>Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, commended the initiative as a model of the University&#x2019;s work to advance <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">Health and the Human Condition</a> under the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</a></p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is striking that there are currently no protocols for the use of cryotherapy devices despite awareness of risks to patients,&#x201D; Bavier said. &#x201C;This valuable work will provide the knowledge and new technologies needed to ensure patient safety while providing the benefits that cooling treatments have been known for since the time of Hippocrates.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About the UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation&#xA0; </span></b></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/nursing/\">UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation</a> is a leader in the development of scientific evidence and educational models that equip nurses and other health care professionals to effectively and quickly integrate into the healthcare scientific and practice workforce.&#xA0;With 19,000 students in campus-based online degree programs, the College is one of the largest and most successful in the United States.

But the precise ecological conditions that produced these responses were not known.</p>\n<p>Researchers at The University of Texas at Arlington have now provided the first evidence that stable environments like constant predator threats, not unstable conditions, generate these non-genetic &#x201C;trans-generational responses&#x201D; in the next generation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These results have broad implications for understanding responses to climate change, the spread of invasive species, changes in the availability of food sources or other threats, &#x201D; said Matthew Walsh, UTA assistant biology professor and leader of the study.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In times of rapid change, organisms like mammals with a long reproductive cycle would perceive the ecological conditions as unstable and not evolve this &#x201C;transgenerational response&#x201D;, which may affect their long-term survival,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Organisms that mature in days like water fleas would not perceive any changes and could continue to do so, and perhaps progressively improve their fitness.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<p>Walsh and his team used the interplay of fish and their prey, water fleas, to demonstrate the ecological conditions needed for &#x201C;trans-generational response.&#x201D; They found that water fleas from populations that experience consistently intense predation responded by programming future generations to develop 10 percent faster to enhance survival rates.</p>\n<p>At the same time, parental water fleas that experience variations in predations responded by accelerating their own maturation but did not generate &#x201C;trans-generational responses&#x201D; in the next generation.</p>\n<p>The findings were published in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</i>, as <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1823/20152271\">&#x201C;Local adaptation in trans-generational responses to predators.&#x201D;</a> Walsh was accompanied on this study by Stephan Munch of the National Marine Fisheries Service; David Post of Yale University&#x2019;s Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department; and Todd Castoe, Julian Holmes, Michelle Packer, Kelsey Biles and Melissa Walsh, all from UTA. The research was supported through <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/provost/faculty-programs/research-enhancement-program.php\">UTA&#x2019;s Research Enhancement Program</a>.</p>\n<p>This new study builds on a previous work in which Walsh demonstrated that one generation can speed up its own maturation in response to a predator threat or speed up the maturation of its offspring, but not do both.&#xA0; That paper, <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1798/20142205\">&#x201C;Predator-induced phenotypic plasticity within-and across-generations: A Challenge for theory?&#x201D;</a> was also published in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B,</i> and forms part of his ongoing study of how organisms alter the expression of traits across multiple generations.</p>\n<p>Morteza Khaledi, dean of the UTA College of Science, commended Walsh on his continued efforts to bridge ecology and evolution.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This research provides key information on evolutionary response to environmental threats and aligns with the university&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions Global Impact</a>, under the theme of Global Environmental Impact,&#x201D; Khaledi said. &#x201C;These responses are widespread across many species, and a better understanding of these mechanisms helps us all.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In 2015, Matthew Walsh received a $220,000 National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research Grant to extend his research to study the aquatic habitats of Alaska and Wisconsin to better document, understand and predict how organisms respond to natural change that is influenced by humans or environmental pollutants.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This forms part of my long-term goal of building a research program integrating ecological and evolutionary studies,&#x201D; Walsh said. &#x201C;We need to build awareness of the vulnerability of ecosystems to anthropogenic change.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of more than 50,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

The THECB announced the new goal in 2015 as a continuation of the &#x201C;Closing the Gaps&#x201D; campaign to better serve the educational needs of Texas. UTA met and in many cases far exceeded the Closing the Gaps goals set for it by the Coordinating Board.</p>\n<p>The conference is open to area public school systems, community colleges and other four-year universities, business and industry, government and nonprofit educational organizations.</p>\n<p>Speakers will include THECB Commissioner Raymund Paredes, UTA President Vistasp M. Karbhari, and Kati Haycock, president of The Education Trust, who will provide the luncheon keynote.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The&#xA0;<em>60x30TX</em>&#xA0;plan&#xA0;is bold with big goals to achieve over the next 15 years,&#x201D; Commissioner Paredes said. &#x201C;They will be a challenge to achieve, but it is something that we must do to maintain a growing economy and ensure a prosperous future for Texas. I anticipate that North Texas will identify and implement strategies that help this region and the state achieve our <em>60x30TX</em><i>&#xA0;</i>goals.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>President Karbhari added, &#x201C;I am proud UTA worked aggressively to meet THECB&#x2019;s Closing the Gaps goals set for us and not only met but exceeded most by large margins. The <em>60X30TX</em> conference &#x201C;Access, Success, Texas&#x201D; provides the opportunity for all of us to commit to being even more successful in meeting with the new statewide goals.

Her work is focused on medical instrumentation and imaging, minimally invasive and noninvasive spectroscopy and imaging of tissue, optical diffuse imaging for cancer prognosis, and brain activities.</p>\n<p>The Institute specifically recognized Liu&#x2019;s &#x201C;significant contributions to the development of near infrared spectroscopy/imaging and their broad applications for biomedicine.&#x201D; She will be formally inducted into the Institute&#x2019;s College of Fellows on April 4 during a ceremony at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is very comforting and encouraging that my persistent efforts over the past 25 years are well recognized and rewarded by one of the most respected scientific organizations in my field,&#x201D; Liu said. &#x201C;This recognition is very important to me personally, and it also demonstrates to many young scientists and junior faculty members that, in spite of original nationality and/or various educational backgrounds, many of us can achieve our professional successes and make our dreams come true if we believe in ourselves and make sincere efforts.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Liu joins Michael Cho, chair of the UTA <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/be\">Bioengineering Department</a>, Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the UTA <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering\">College of Engineering</a>, and UTA bioengineering professors Charles Chuong and Liping Tang as fellows of AIMBE.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://aimbe.org\">American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering</a> represents 50,000 individuals and the top 2 percent of medical and biological engineers. The <a href=\"http://aimbe.org/college-of-fellows/directory/\">College of Fellows</a> consists of the top 2 percent of AIMBE members.</p>\n<p>Cho said, &#x201C;Dr. Liu&#x2019;s accomplishments span beyond the worlds of bioengineering and medicine. Her research in brain imaging really speaks to what bioengineering can do to advance diagnostics and potential treatment for brain diseases.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Behbehani said Liu&#x2019;s honor is &#x201C;a very well-deserved honor and recognition of her accomplishments.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Her contributions to the field of optical medical imaging are many, and her research continues to help people to live better lives,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Her tireless contributions to the College have significantly contributed to our strength in bioengineering, and I am happy that she has been recognized at the highest level of her field.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Liu credited her colleagues, collaborators, and graduate students for helping her achieve the honor, but expressed special thanks to Robert Eberhart, who hired her 20 years ago and believed in her even though she wasn&#x2019;t sure she could handle the job. Eberhart is a UTA bioengineering professor emeritus and was chair of the joint UT Southwestern/UTA Graduate Bioengineering Program from 1983-2000.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Taking the job at UTA was exciting, but also challenging. Bioengineering is very multidisciplinary, requiring solid knowledge from both engineering and biology/medicine, but I earned all of my degrees in physics and applied physics,&#x201D; Liu said. &#x201C;I also am grateful to my former department chair and current dean, Khosrow Behbehani, and former Dean Bill Carroll, who supported me strongly so that I could concentrate on my professional development over the years.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Liu has studied traumatic brain injuries extensively with her collaborator, Alexa Smith-Osborne, an associate professor in UTA&#x2019;s School of Social Work. They have developed a portable brain-mapping device that allows them to &#x201C;see&#x201D; where memory fails student veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>\n<p>That research led the team to discover that shining low-level light on the brain by placing the light source on the skull can stimulate and energize neurons to function more effectively. When cells are stimulated with light, they remain stimulated for a lengthy period of time even after the light is removed. The approach differs from other therapies that use magnets or electric shocks and has the potential to yield effective, longer-lasting treatments.</p>\n<p>Liu&#x2019;s previous projects include a 2010 National Institutes of Health grant of almost $1 million to investigate a minimally invasive method of screening and diagnosing prostate cancer using a multichannel optical imaging system. She also won a 2009 Department of Defense Prostate Research Program grant to develop an optical detection system that allows physicians to find lesions that may have cancer, correctly estimate the cancer&#x2019;s severity and identify tiny, low-grade cancers not likely to cause problems.</p>\n<p>This month, Liu signed a contract to assist UT Southwestern Medical Center&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/research/brain-injury/index.html\">Texas Institute for Brain Injury and Repair</a> with a traumatic brain injury study.</p>\n<p>Liu is a member of the UTA Academy of Distinguished Scholars and also is a member of <a href=\"http://www.osa.org/en-us/home/\">The Optical Society</a> and <a href=\"http://www.spie.org\">SPIE</a>, the international optical engineering society.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington </span></b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution of more than 51,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Kribs is also an expert in mathematical epidemiology with research supported by the National Science Foundation.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The study showed that students who are failing at two or more subjects are at risk for dropping out, largely due to their increased interactions with other failing students.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Positive parenting is clearly very important for students but the study discovered that there is a point where negative peer influences overcome positive parental influences,&#x201D; Kribs said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We feel there is a real opportunity to intervene at the school level to reduce dropout rates by controlling negative influences,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>The study looked at 125 students at a struggling high school in Chicago. The researchers surveyed the students on whether they were failing in core subjects such as mathematics, English, science and social sciences, the degree of parental involvement in their life and the number of failing and dropout friends of each student during the last year.</p>\n<p>The mathematical model they developed defined students as being in one of two environments: a non-risky environment, where they are passing all core subjects or failing one and considered vulnerable; or a risky environment, where they are failing two or more core subjects and could drop out.</p>\n<p>The data suggests that as the degree of parental involvement in a vulnerable student&#x2019;s life increases, the number of their failing friends decreases.</p>\n<p>If the student is already failing two core courses and in the risky zone, the effectiveness of parental involvement changes: the number of their failing friends initially decreases, but then increases again. This may occur if students become more rebellious to a sudden increase in parental involvement at the same time they are receiving negative peer pressure from other failing students.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Parental guidance is a significant factor only when students are under a low level of negative social influence at school,&#x201D; Kribs said. &#x201C;If negative social influence increases beyond a critical value, the impact of parental influence becomes negligible. To manage dropout levels, we need to manage social influences at school.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The paper concludes that making sure that vulnerable and failing students are not only mixing with other failing and dropout students could achieve a sustained reduction in dropout rates.</p>\n<p>Jianzhong Su, UTA mathematics chair, emphasized the importance of this project within the strategic theme of data-driven discovery within UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions, Global Impact. </a></p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Kribs&#x2019; work shows the relevance of mathematical studies to real-life social issues and demonstrates the importance of cross-disciplinary studies on social problems,&#x201D; Su said. &#x201C;The next step would be to roll the model out with larger groups of students to further demonstrate its accuracy and efficacy to education policymakers to make a real difference.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Kribs collaborated on this study with Anuj Mubayi, assistant professor of applied mathematics in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change as well as in the Simon&#xA0;A.&#xA0;Levin Mathematical Computational Modeling Science Center at Arizona State University-Tempe; Bechir Amdouni, developmental mathematics instructor at Northeastern Illinois University and Marlio Paredes, mathematics professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey.</p>\n<p>The full study, <a href=\"http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/473/2197/20160204\">&#x201C;Why do students quit school?

One type of abstraction&#x2014;virtualization&#x2014;is a key component of cloud computing and has changed how computer systems use resources by allowing multiple virtual computer architectures and systems to run off of a single physical machine. However, performance, cost-effectiveness and predictability issues are keeping virtualization out of domains such as scientific computing and big-data analytics.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The problem with existing abstractions in virtual systems is that, despite the benefits to cloud computing, abstractions incur a lot of inefficiency and unpredictability to cloud users,&#x201D; Rao said. &#x201C;Our intention is to improve resource management in any kind of virtual system to enable elastic, effective and efficient use of those resources.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual copy of real physical resources to help ease the management of computer systems and allow maximum flexibility in resource management. Using virtualization, it is possible to build a computer system where several virtual machines, each assigned to different users, can run off one physical machine. However, it is difficult to meet each individual&#x2019;s needs and maintain high utilization and efficiency in the system due to semantic gaps, or critical missing information between levels of abstraction.</p>\n<p>For instance, a user of a virtual machine has the illusion of a dedicated resource and continuous availability, but those resources are actually built upon a physical resource shared among many users. Since resource management software was designed for a physical system with continuous availability, the software doesn&#x2019;t work efficiently in a virtualized environment because each user&#x2019;s demands on the physical system are different.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We hope to bridge these semantic gaps by augmenting existing, regularly adopted abstractions while retaining the benefits of abstraction, including modality, security and portability,&#x201D; Rao said. &#x201C;We will then use the knowledge we develop in designing abstractions in virtualized systems to guide the design of abstractions in future hardware systems that will support multi-tenacy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>His research is an example of data-driven discovery, one of the themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact, said Peter Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Cloud computing has changed how the world uses computer networks, and Dr. Rao&#x2019;s research will make the cloud more efficient. This could lead to even greater opportunities for business, the scientific community and anyone who uses the cloud as part of their daily lives,&#x201D; Crouch said.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Seven other UTA faculty have received NSF CAREER Award grants while employed at the University:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Matthew Walsh of the Biology Department received $600,000 in 2017 to study whether behavioral plasticity promotes or constrains adaptation.</li>\n<li>Majie Fan of the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department received $485,627 in 2015 to enhance understanding of how the Rocky Mountains and its modern, elevated landscape came to be.</li>\n<li>Yi Hong in the Bioengineering Department received $500,000 in 2016 to develop a polymer that will allow engineers to develop a scaffold that is flexible, conductive and biodegradable for biomedical applications such as tissue repair.</li>\n<li>Junzhou Huang of the Computer Science and Engineering Department received $545,763 in 2016 to discover a process by which image-omics data can be combined into files that are small enough that current computing technology will allow scientists to better predict how long a patient will live and how best to treat him or her.</li>\n<li>Ankur Jain in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department received $500,000 in 2016 to develop a fundamental understanding of how heat flows in materials within a Li-ion battery so they can be used safely in more applications.</li>\n<li>Alice Sun in the Electrical Engineering Department received $500,000 in 2016 to develop an all-liquid optofluidic laser that could better detect cancer in the comfort of a doctor&#x2019;s office.</li>\n<li>Kyungsuk Yum in the Materials Science and Engineering Department received $500,000 to design and develop bioinspired 3D materials with programmed shapes and motions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Computer Science and Engineering Department offers degrees in computer engineering, computer science and software engineering.

        "body": "\n<p>Nearly 2 million miles of natural gas pipelines crisscross the United States, most buried underground, and some of those pipes develop leaks and allow gas to escape. As evidenced by several recent high-profile incidents, these leaks may lead to catastrophe.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Kathleen Smits\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/kathleen-smits-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Kathleen Smits,&#xA0;an associate professor in the Civil Engineering Department at The University of Texas at Arlington, recently received a $414,000 grant from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Kathleen Smits, an associate professor in the Civil Engineering Department at The University of Texas at Arlington, recently received a $414,000 grant from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to develop a method to predict the conditions under which gas migration may occur and establish best practices to improve response to gas migration incidents, and finding and fixing leaks.</p>\n<p>She will lead a team of researchers at Colorado State University and UTA in collaboration with state agencies such as the Texas Railroad Commission and the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, and industry partners including pipeline operators and service providers.</p>\n<p>When a pipe develops a leak underground the gas generally doesn&#x2019;t rise straight up from the leak site. Rather, it disperses in different directions depending on the type of soil, temperature, pressure and other factors. Eventually, it rises to the surface, but it may not be anywhere near the leak and the levels of gas in the atmosphere where it comes out at another location are often not detectable with current instruments, even though large pockets of gas may still be trapped underground. This migration and difficulty in detection costs time in finding and repairing the leak. It also may lead to greater danger as the gas continues to build up.</p>\n<p>Smits and her colleague, Dan Zimmerle of Colorado State University, created a pipeline test bed as part of the Methane Emissions and Technology Evaluation Center or METEC that allows them to control the pipeline leakage rate, subsurface conditions, moisture, surface conditions and other factors, and use sensors to monitor how gas moves underground and how it acts once it reaches the surface. Using the data collected, the team has created a data set that can predict how gas will act under specific subsurface and atmospheric conditions. Smits is now working to apply this modeling to create an algorithm that can be applied in the field by industry leak first responders.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our research shows interesting results that go against the conventional wisdom that if there&#x2019;s a large leak you&#x2019;ll be able to see it or easily detect it aboveground. In fact, we have found that the concentrations of gas in the atmosphere are often very small in comparison to the size of the leak,&#x201D; Smits said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt=\"pipeline testbed field site in Colorado\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/gas-pipeline-testbed-field-site-smits.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Smits is leading the project, which includes research at the pipeline testbed field site at the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center in Fort Collins, Colo.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;The methods being used today to detect natural gas leaks from pipelines are flawed because most of the technologies are not sensitive enough, the methods aren&#x2019;t consistent enough, and there&#x2019;s a general denial that there&#x2019;s a problem. We&#x2019;re hoping that by providing data-based guidelines for industry first responders that allow them to take all of the environmental and geological factors into account at a potential leak site, leaks will be detected and repaired before they become a larger problem.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Once Smits completes her algorithm, she and her team will accompany first responders from five industry leaders to leak sites to test whether their modeling works and get the industry on board with the new guidelines.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s important for oil and gas companies to show that they&#x2019;re trying to get a handle on the problem. With so many pipelines and aging infrastructure, leaks are inevitable. Companies need to be able to reassure their customers and communities that they are able to detect and repair leaks effectively to ensure safety,&#x201D; Smits said.</p>\n<p>Smits&#x2019; research is an example of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, said Ali Abolmaali, chair of the Civil Engineering Department.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Natural gas has led to several deadly explosions in the past few years that could have potentially been avoided if there was a better understanding of how gas acts when it leaks from a pipe and how to better detect it. Dr. Smits and her team have done excellent work in their research, and in getting cooperation from industry to apply their findings in a way that could save lives and property,&#x201D; Abolmaali said.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>About Civil Engineering</b></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Civil Engineering Department enrollment exceeds 1,200 students.

The goal is to explain how the different forecast models were combined, then identify which attributes of each model are strengths and weaknesses in the context of the current event and explain how the different forecasts are combined in the context of the current event,&#x201D; Seo said.</p>\n<p>Weather and water information during major events is provided by the National Weather Service and local forecasting groups, while many other entities, such as the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and universities also produce flooding and other water-related information. Since the information is coming multiple sources, it can be difficult to make full sense of the data. For example, during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, emergency management personnel and officials at all levels of local, regional and state government found it difficult to digest all of the information consistently in real time to make decisions about evacuations and other life-or-death situations.</p>\n<p>Seo will apply a Bayesian model to forecasting, which will allow him to add new information to what is already known to update knowledge, then combine the parts to provide the most accurate forecast. In this application, forecasts and metrics will be entered into a multi-model merging module, then put out as an integrated forecast, which will reduce forecast uncertainty. Emergency management officials will then have a greater understanding of how each forecast impacted the integrated forecast, which will allow greater confidence in the decisions they make going forward.</p>\n<p>Seo&#x2019;s research in flood forecasting, the National Water Model and other water-related areas is an example of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, said Ali Abolmaali, chair of the Department of Civil Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Hurricanes and flooding cause a great deal of damage and endanger millions of people each year. The work Dr. Seo is doing will greatly enhance the ability of municipalities to make decisions based on in-depth information that will keep their citizens safe and lessen the impact of these storms on their communities,&#x201D; Abolmaali said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n"

The 10-inch long specimen was preserved in a museum collection. Amazingly, a live specimen has never been found in the ensuing 42 years.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This small snake was obtained now over 40 years ago, and the report of its discovery has been a long time in coming,&#x201D; the co-authors wrote in the&#xA0;<i>Journal of Herpetology</i>&#xA0;paper. &#x201C;We were optimistic that additional specimens might be secured, but after at least a dozen more trips into the region spanning several decades, we have been unrewarded.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><i>Cenaspis</i>&#xA0;has several unique features that defy placing it in any known genus and clearly distinguishes it from all known genera. These include undivided subcaudal scales, or enlarged plates on the underside of its tail; a lack of spines and presence of cup-like structures called calyces on its hemipenes, or paired male reproductive organs found in snakes and lizards; and the shape of its skull.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt=\"A new species of snake\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/cenaspis-snake.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>UTA researchers found a new species of snake.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The first two of those features are not found in any other known snake in the family&#xA0;<i>Colubridae</i>&#xA0;in the Western Hemisphere.&#xA0;<i>Colubridae</i>&#xA0;is the largest snake family and includes just over 51 percent of all known living snake species.</p>\n<p>Utilizing the vast resources of UTA&#x2019;s Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center for comparative purposes, the researchers made CT scans of dozens of specimens of snakes. The biologists believe that due to some of the specimen&#x2019;s physical features,&#xA0;<i>Cenaspis</i>&#xA0;is likely a burrowing snake that feeds on insects and spiders. Campbell believes that&#xA0;<i>Cenaspis</i>&#xA0;is not extinct but has eluded capture due to its burrowing lifestyle and other elusive habits.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This provides evidence of just how secretive some snakes can be,&#x201D; Campbell told&#xA0;<i>National Geographic</i>, which ran a story about the discovery in its Dec, 19, 2018, edition. &#x201C;Combine their elusive habits with restricted ranges and some snakes do not turn up often.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He noted said that because of the snake&#x2019;s unique nature, the Chiapas highlands area of southern Mexico where it was found all those years ago should be considered for protected status, so that more unknown species can be discovered and not face possible extinction.</p>\n<p>Campbell is one of the world&#x2019;s pre-eminent herpetologists and has spent over 45 years discovering, studying and describing the herpetofauna of North, Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean and West Africa. He earned a doctorate in systematics and ecology from the University of Kansas in 1982 and came to UTA in 1983. He has overseen the tremendous growth of UTA&#x2019;s Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center from a modest collection into one of the top centers for herpetology in the world, with one of the largest collections of specimens anywhere. His work has described more than 100 new species, some of which were on the brink of becoming extinct without ever being known.</p>\n<p>Smith came to UTA in 1992 for graduate school and has been here ever since. He earned an master&#x2019;s degree in biology in 1994 and a doctorate in quantitative biology in 2001, then worked as a postdoctoral associate and research associate before joining the Department of Biology faculty as an assistant professor in 2006. He has conducted extensive research of snake species in North and Central America and Indonesia, conducting frequent field and collection work and publishing dozens of journal articles. He also collaborates with other researchers on large-scale temporal and spatial biogeography and biodiversity studies.</p>\n<p>Hall worked as a postdoctoral researcher at UTA in 2017 after receiving his doctorate, then accepted a position with Thermo Fisher Scientific, a biotechnology product development company, as a product application specialist.

Our excellence is demonstrated by our newly graduated, online, Family Nurse Practitioner, students&#x2019; first time certification pass rate of 96 percent in 2017.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said nursing continues to be one of the most sought-after degrees, both among students and among industry.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I am pleased to see national recognition of the excellence of our graduate programs in nursing,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;This is a reflection of the commitment of our faculty to ensuring that UTA plays a leading role in not just addressing the issue of nursing shortages in Texas but does this in a way that ensures the highest level of academic rigor and quality of instruction and training. Our nurses are highly sought after by hospitals and health care providers across the state and nation, and this ranking further emphasizes the tremendous efforts of our dedicated faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Larry Gomez, who earned his MSN online from UTA in December 2017, said he liked the program because of its convenience and the responsiveness of the professors. He said found the program challenging and that appealed to him as well.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I was a returning adult,&#x201D; said Gomez, an emergency room nurse practitioner who also works as an EMS supervisor for the Houston Fire Department. &#x201C;I had two jobs, a wife and three kids. I liked the convenience of being able to access the lectures and materials 24 hours a day. And the professors were great. They were so responsive to the needs of students. They were literarily a phone call, email or text away. They were quick to respond and very well organized.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Gomez liked the program so much that he&#x2019;s returning to UTA next month to pursue his doctor of nursing practice or DNP degree, a program that takes about two years to complete.</p>\n<p>The College of Nursing and Health Innovation (CONHI) ranked No. 50 among master&#x2019;s of nursing programs in U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x2019;s 2019 Best Graduate Schools. It ranked No. 52 in the nation in its doctor of nursing practice programs, which is second best in the state.</p>\n<p>Other accolades CONHI has achieved include:</p>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>No. 1 in Texas and No. 9 in the nation for veteran friendliness as ranked by College Factual. The rankings look for colleges that produce quality outcomes in nursing and offer support and resources to help veterans and active-duty military students thrive.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>CONHI is designated a Center of Excellence by the&#xA0;National League for Nursing for Enhancing Student Learning and Professional Development.</li>\n<li>No. 7 on the&#xA0;Top 20 Online Nursing Degree Programs<b>&#xA0;</b>list by OnlineSchoolsCenter.com in 2019.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

We&#x2019;re excited about the possibilities Newcastle brought us.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Newcastle started as a consulting company in 2002, offering professional services for manufacturers, logistics and supply chain industry. In 2015 Newcastle created a new manufacturing division to complement a consulting practice and address the needs that have arisen in multiple sectors. The company has recently added UAVs to its menu of manufacturing and consulting options.</p>\n<p>Kunkel is just trying to give back to the community of first responders.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Their jobs could become exponentially easier if they have both hands free to investigate an accident. Sometimes, it could mean the difference between life and death,&#x201D; Kunkel said. &#x201C;Spotlights on these well-equipped, multi-function drones would give them that freedom.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Aditya Das, UTARI senior research scientist in the Automation and Intelligent Systems Division, said other possible uses for the technology could be for mapping out oil excavation areas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In partnership with Newcastle, the next phase of the work will be to utilize deep-learning methods to track objects at night,&#x201D; Das said. &#x201C;UTARI plans to leverage these capabilities for applications including the tracking of feral hogs, which create billions of dollars in damage in Texas and throughout the United States every year.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About UTARI</span></b></p>\n<p>UTARI leads technology-based economic development through research collaborations with business and industry.
