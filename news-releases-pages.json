The unconventional results are consistent with Newton&#x2019;s Second Law of Motion, a well-established law of physics, and imply that mass should be included in the dynamic model of these nano-systems.

This resulted in faster run times but,\nparadoxically, violated Newton&#x2019;s second law upon which the conventional model\nwas based. The remedy for this paradox was to argue that mass was unimportant\nat the nano-scale.</p>\n<p>However, the new model retains mass, and predicts unexpected\nmotion of nano-sized objects in a fluid that has been experimentally observed.\nThe new model also runs much faster than both the conventional and massless\nmodels.</p>\n<p>It is expected that this new model will significantly accelerate\nresearch involving small-scale phenomena.</p>\n<p>Research areas that Bowling and collaborators at UT Arlington are\ncurrently investigating include cell migration, protein function, bionic\nmedical devices and nanoparticle suspensions for storing thermal energy.\nHowever, the applications for the computer simulation in medicine, biology, and\nother fields are endless.</p>\n<p>The research is detailed in the paper&#xA0;<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11071-013-1185-0\">&#x201C;Dynamics\nof Microscopic Objects in Optical Tweezers: Experimental Determination of\nUnderdamped Regime and Numerical Simulation using Multiscale Analysis&#x201D;</a>&#xA0;and\npublished online by the&#xA0;<i>Journal of Non-Linear Dynamics.&#xA0;</i>The\npaper is scheduled for publication in the journal&#x2019;s print version later this\nyear.</p>\n<p>Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/\" title=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/index.php\">College of Engineering</a>,\nsaid the team&#x2019;s findings may alter ways of thinking throughout the engineering\nand scientific worlds.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The paper is only the beginning for this research,&#x201D; Behbehani\nsaid. &#x201C;I anticipate a high level of interest in the findings.

Armstrong has come up with a new, more sensitive test for evidence of performance enhancing drugs.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Daniel W. Armstrong, who holds\nthe UT Arlington Robert A. Welch Chair in Chemistry, and Hongyue Guo, a\ngraduate student in Armstrong&#x2019;s lab, presented the research this week at the\n247<sup>th</sup> National Meeting &amp; Exposition of the American Chemical\nSociety in Dallas. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;How much of a drug someone took or how long\nago they took it are beyond the analyst&#x2019;s control. The only thing you can\ncontrol is how sensitive your method is,&#x201D; Armstrong said. &#x201C;Our goal is to\ndevelop ultra-sensitive methods that will extend the window of detection, and we\nmay have developed one of the most sensitive methods in the world.&#x201D;<b>&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p>According to the\nAmerican Chemical Society, the new strategy is a simple variation on a common\ntesting technique called mass spectrometry, which the International Olympic\nCommittee, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and others routinely use to ensure\nathletes are &#x201C;clean.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mass spectrometry separates\ncompounds by mass, or weight, allowing scientists to determine the component\nparts of a mixture. In the case of performance enhancing drugs, technicians use\nthe method to find the bits left over in blood, urine or other body fluids\nafter the body breaks the substances down.</p>\n<p>Because some of the pieces, or metabolites,\nare small and have a negative charge, they may not produce a signal strong\nenough for the instrument to detect, Armstrong explained &#x2013; especially in the\ncase of stimulants, which the body rapidly eliminates. Stimulants like\namphetamine, or &#x201C;speed,&#x201D; increase alertness and reduce an athlete&#x2019;s sense of\nfatigue.</p>\n<p>The method Armstrong&#x2019;s lab has pioneered is called\npaired ion electrospray ionization (PIESI, pronounced &#x201C;PIE-zee&#x201D;). It gathers several\nof those drug bits together, making them more obvious to the detector. The new\nmethod does not require additional equipment for testing labs, only the\naddition of a chemical the Armstrong team designed which is now commercially\navailable and relatively inexpensive, Guo said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Armstrong&#x2019;s pioneering\nmethods for improving chemical separations have been honored with a long list\nof national and international awards, including his being named a fellow of the\nAmerican Chemical Society,&#x201D; said Carolyn Cason, vice president for research at\nUT Arlington. &#x201C;Equally impressive is his continual quest to apply those\nprincipals to issues that face society and to involve the students he mentors\nin those explorations. This work is an example of the impressive results that\nstem from those endeavors.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The UT Arlington team explained\ntheir research at a news conference in Dallas Wednesday. Video from that event\nis available online at <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/45066065\">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/45066065</a>.</p>\n<p>Armstrong joined UT\nArlington in 2006 and is the author of more than 550 scientific publications,\nincluding 29 book chapters, and holds 23 U.S. and international patents. During\nthis week&#x2019;s conference, he is also being honored with the ACS Award in\nSeparation Science and Technology, which is sponsored by Waters Corp.</p>\n<p>Armstrong\nreceived the ACS Award for Chromatography in 1999 and has also won the 1998<b> </b>ACS\nHelen M. Free Award for Public Outreach, as well as numerous other awards. Last\nyear, he was named to the 2013 class of ACS Fellows.</p>\n<p>The American Chemical Society\nis the world&#x2019;s largest scientific society, with 161,000 members. </p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About UT Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research\ninstitution and the second largest institution in The University of Texas\nSystem. <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> ranked UT Arlington as the\nseventh fastest-growing public research university in 2013. <i>U.S. News &amp;\nWorld Report</i> ranks UT Arlington fifth in the nation for undergraduate\ndiversity.

Chiao designed and built the device that is about 1.8 mm at its widest point. A single grain of rice could hold about 10 of these tiny windmills. Hundreds of the windmills could be embedded in a sleeve for a cell phone. Wind, created by waving the cell phone in air or holding it up to an open window on a windy day, would generate the electricity that could be collected by the cell phone&#x2019;s battery.</p>\n<p>Rao&#x2019;s works in micro-robotic devices initially heightened a Taiwanese company&#x2019;s interest in having Rao and Chiao brainstorm over novel device designs and applications for the company&#x2019;s unique fabrication techniques, which are known in the semiconductor industry for their reliability.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image-caption-left photocaption300\">null<figcaption>UT Arlington Research Associate Smitha Rao</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;The company was quite surprised with the micro-windmill idea when we showed the demo video of working devices,&#x201D; Rao said. &#x201C;It was something completely out of the blue for them and their investors.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Rao&#x2019;s designs blend origami concepts into conventional wafer-scale semiconductor device layouts so complex 3-D moveable mechanical structures can be self-assembled from two-dimensional metal pieces utilizing planar multilayer electroplating techniques that have been optimized by WinMEMS Technologies Co., the Taiwanese fabrication foundry that took an initial interest in Rao&#x2019;s work.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The micro-windmills work well because the metal alloy is flexible and Smitha&#x2019;s design follows minimalism for functionality.&#x201D; Chiao said.</p>\n<p>WinMEMS became interested in the micro-electro mechanical system research and started a relationship with UT Arlington. Company representatives visited with the UT Arlington team several times in 2013 to discuss collaboration.</p>\n<p>An agreement has been established for UT Arlington to hold the intellectual properties while WinMEMS explores the commercialization opportunities. UT Arlington has applied for a provisional patent.</p>\n<p>Currently, WinMEMS has been showcasing UT Arlington&#x2019;s works on its <a href=\"http://www.winmemstech.com/en/page/custom68/\">website</a> and in public presentations, which include the micro-windmills, gears, inductors, pop-up switches and grippers. All of those parts are as tiny as a fraction of the diameter of a human hair.</p>\n<p>These inventions are essential to build micro-robots that can be used as surgical tools, sensing machines to explore disaster zones or manufacturing tools to assemble micro-machines.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s very gratifying to first be noticed by an international company and second to work on something like this where you can see immediately how it might be used,&#x201D; said Rao, who earned her Ph.D in 2009 at UT Arlington. &#x201C;However, I think we&#x2019;ve only scratched the surface on how these micro-windmills might be used.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The micro windmills were tested successfully in September 2013 in Chiao&#x2019;s lab. The windmills operate under strong artificial winds without any fracture in the material because of the durable nickel alloy and smart aerodynamic design.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The problem most MEMS designers have is that materials are too brittle,&#x201D; Rao said. &#x201C;With the nickel alloy, we don&#x2019;t have that same issue. They&#x2019;re very, very durable.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The micro-windmills can be made in an array using the batch processes. The fabrication cost of making one device is the same as making hundreds or thousands on a single wafer, which enables for mass production of very inexpensive systems.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Imagine that they can be cheaply made on the surfaces of portable electronics,&#x201D; Chiao said, &#x201C;so you can place them on a sleeve for your smart phone. When the phone is out of battery power, all you need to do is to put on the sleeve, wave the phone in the air for a few minutes and you can use the phone again.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Chiao said because of the small sizes, flat panels with thousand of windmills could be made and mounted on the walls of houses or building to harvest energy for lighting, security or environmental sensing and wireless communication.</p>\n<p>He added that it has been fulfilling to see his former student succeed and help move innovation toward the marketplace.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;To see a company recognize that and seek you out for your expertise speaks volumes about what UT Arlington means to the world,&#x201D; he said proudly.</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution of more than 33,300 students and 2,300 faculty members in the epicenter of North Texas. It is the second largest institution in the University of Texas System. Research expenditures reached almost $78 million last year.

Through photosynthesis, the Amazon absorbs 1.5\nbillion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year in a process that\nrequires input of nitrogen. That nitrogen, for the most part, comes from a\nprocess called nitrogen fixation &#x2013; essentially microbes pulling nitrogen form\nthe air into the soil.</p>\n<p>The new paper, featured in the\nJanuary issue of<i> Applied and\nEnvironmental Microbiology</i>, looks for the first time at the reaction of\nfree-living nitrogen-fixing microorganisms called diazotrophs to the\ndeforestation. Jorge Rodrigues, an assistant professor of biology at The\nUniversity of Texas at Arlington, organized the work. Babur S. Mirza, formerly\na postdoctoral fellow in the Rodrigues lab, is the paper&apos;s lead author.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image-caption-right photocaption200\">null<figcaption>A photo from a new UT Arlington paper is on the cover of the January issue of Applied and Environmental Microbiology.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;This study\nshows that although the diversity of diazotrophic microorganisms remains the\nsame with the conversion from forest to pasture, the types of species found are\ndifferent,&#x201D; said Rodrigues. &#x201C;Our\nnext step is to measure how the rates of biological nitrogen fixation are\ninfluenced by community changes. Because the carbon and nitrogen cycles are so\nstrongly linked, our previous results indicated that changes in carbon dioxide\nsequestration will occur&quot;\n</p>\n<p>Rodrigues&#x2019; team gathered samples\nof soil from the Fazenda Nova Vida site in Rondonia, Brazil, one of three\nstates in the country that accounted for more than 85 percent of deforestation from\n1996 to 2005. They analyzed soil from a primary forest, a pasture established\nin 2004 and a secondary forest that resulted from the abandonment of a pasture\nin 1999. </p>\n<p>The team used DNA analysis,\nspecifically the nifH gene that is characteristic of diazotrophs, to measure\nthe communities in the samples.</p>\n<p>Rodrigues said researchers were\nsurprised to find a ten-fold increase in the number of diazotrophic\nmicroorganisms in the pasture established in 2004, when compared to the primary\nforests. They theorize the pasture ecosystems rely on the diazotrophs more for\nnitrogen because of the continuous grazing from cattle, requiring constant regrowth\nof grasses. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;We observed a complete shift in the diazotrophic\nmicrobial community composition in response to the Amazon rain forest\nconversion to a pasture,&#x201D; Mirza said. &#x201C;These differences an be attributed to\nthe shift in the above ground plant community because we did see partial\nrecovery of diazotroph community composition in the secondary forest, which\nhave more plant species as compared to pasture.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mirza said researchers are\ncontinuing their work with more more sophisticated sequencing technologies and\nin-depth sampling. </p>\n<p>Other co-authors on the new paper include Chotima Potisap, a\nvisiting Ph.D. student from Khon Kaen University in Thailand; Klaus N&#xFC;sslein, professor of microbiology at\nthe University of Massachusetts; and Brendan J.M. Bohannan, professor at the\nInstitute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Oregon.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>The paper is titled &#x201C;Response of Free-Living Nitrogen Fixing\nMicroorganisms to Land Use Change in the Amazon Rainforest&#x201D; and is available\nonline here:&#xA0; <a href=\"http://aem.asm.org/content/early/2013/10/21/AEM.02362-13.full.pdf+html\">http://aem.asm.org/content/early/2013/10/21/AEM.02362-13.full.pdf+html</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite worries about the effect\nthese changes to the microbial communities may have on the carbon cycle,\nRodrigues said there are some encouraging results. After pastures were\nabandoned and a secondary forest grew, partial restoration of the original\ndiazotrophic communities was achieved, researchers said. </p>\n<p>Growth of secondary forest is\nongoing for about 50 percent of the abandoned pastures in the Amazon, but more\nneeds to be done to encourage secondary forests and limit deforestation in the\nfirst place, Rodrigues said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There is still time to recover if we\nact now,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>An Agriculture and Food Research\nInitiative grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture supported the work\ndetailed in the paper.</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at\nArlington is a comprehensive research institution of more than 33,300 students\nand 2,300 faculty members in the epicenter of North Texas.

Ann McFadyen of the College of Business management\ndepartment analyzed FBI reports, case studies and human resource records to\nfocus on the estimated 1 to 3 percent of employees prone to workplace acts of\naggression, such as homicide, suicide or destruction of property.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The\nteam advances the case for &#x201C;mindfully observing&#x201D; employees and found that human\nresources professionals and supervisors can advance health, wellbeing, and\nperformance while averting danger and violence by identifying and managing\nhigh-risk employees, anticipating their needs and providing support and\nresources.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The cause of these problems are\nunderstandable and predictable,&#x201D; said Quick, a Distinguished Professor of\nLeadership and Organizational Behavior. &#x201C;And many times these violent incidents\nshouldn&#x2019;t be viewed as random or surprises.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The paper, <a href=\"http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=2051-6614&amp;volume=1&amp;issue=1&amp;articleid=17107581&amp;show=html\">&#x201C;No\nAccident: Health, Wellbeing, Performance &#x2026; and Danger,&#x201D;</a> is\npublished by the <i>Journal of\nOrganizational Effectiveness: People and Performance. </i>The two teamed with\nOklahoma State University&#x2019;s Debra Nelson on the study. Nelson is the Spears\nSchool of Business Associates&#x2019; Chaired Professor of Business Administration and\nDistinguished Professor of Management. She also was the 2004 Goolsby\nDistinguished Visiting Professor.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Corporations need to plug troubled employees\ninto the social network immediately so they don&#x2019;t store up these negative\nfeelings whenever and wherever they get them,&#x201D; said Quick, who also holds the John and Judy Goolsby-Jacqualyn A. Fouse\nEndowed Chair&#xA0;in the Goolsby Leadership Academy. Quick also is a distinguished\nvisiting scholar at Lancaster University Management School in the United\nKingdom.</p>\n<p>College of Business Dean Rachel Croson\nsaid this type of research adds insight for businesses in the real world.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Businesses often look at these problems\nonly after they occur,&#x201D; Croson said. &#x201C;This research offers companies action\nsteps they can take to prevent such tragedies from occurring. It not only helps\npeople but could save lives.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>McFadyen&#x2019;s role in the research was\nlooking at positive and negative deviant behaviors among employees. Positive\ndeviant acts will often benefit the organization (i.e. going out of one&#x2019;s way\nto help another). Conversely, negative deviant acts will likely have an adverse\nimpact on the organization and have the potential to put the organization or\nothers in danger. </p>\n<p>The study noted that the low intense\nnegative deviant act of incivility is often the starting point of the\nescalation to more dangerous and violent behavior. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Incivility toward another includes\ngossiping, texting in meetings, withholding information, ignoring or simply a\ngeneral lack of respect or regard for others,&#x201D; McFadyen said. &#x201C;What is\nconcerning is that incivility is on the rise in the workplace, with the\nmajority of employees reporting that they have been the target of incivility by\nanother.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Research indicates that most\norganizations have training on ethics and diversity, yet few provide training\non incivility. </p>\n<p>McFadyen said the study gives guidance\non how to train supervisors to recognize and monitor incivility.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Incivility, left unchecked, may lead to\nmore dangerous acts&#x201D;, McFadyen said. &#x201C;Research indicates that, while not all\nacts of incivility lead to violent acts, all violent acts in the workplace were\npreceded by acts of incivility.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>One challenge, Quick said, is that\nemployees often cannot be pre-screened for these tendencies. He said dangerous\nemployees don&#x2019;t often show the inclination for dangerous behavior during the\ninterview process.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s often something that those\nemployees get once they&#x2019;re in a job,&#x201D; Quick said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why socialization and\nmaking sure employees air out what&#x2019;s bothering them are two big factors in\nwhether the behavior eventually becomes an incident.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Quick said it&#x2019;s imperative for\norganizations to keep the employees talking about what it is that&#x2019;s bothering\nthem.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;You can&#x2019;t allow the dangerous employee\nto bury the issue,&#x201D; Quick said. &#x201C;And sometimes organizations have a problem in\nwanting to see the issue come to the surface. Organizations have to admit they\nbe part of the problem.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Quick and the team take actual cases\nwhere dangerous employees took action that ended in a wrongful death, sexual\nassault and management harassment. The team also looked at one positive organizational\ncase where harm and death were averted.</p>\n<p>In addition, the study also shows what\norganizations and people need to do to right themselves after dangerous\nemployees&#x2019; behavior leads to a violent incident.</p>\n<p>Quick said the study outlines a\nfour-step approach if the worse should happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Contain the perpetrator or problem.</li>\n<li>Provide physical and mental caregiving for\nvictims of the incident.</li>\n<li>Encourage forgiveness of the dangerous employee.\nForgiveness is not condoning, excusing, denying, minimizing or forgetting a\nwrong.</li>\n<li>Learning from the dangerous employee&#x2019;s incident.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is\na comprehensive research institution and the second largest institution in The\nUniversity of Texas System.&#xA0;<i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>&#xA0;ranked\nUT Arlington as the seventh fastest-growing public research university in\n2013.&#xA0;<i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>&#xA0;ranks UT Arlington fifth in\nthe nation for undergraduate diversity.

Fordjour is one of just 60 undergraduate scholars\nfrom across the United States selected from a field of 600 applicants. In\nApril, the winners will present their research to members of Congress,\nCongressional staffers and staff from government agencies.\n</p>\n<p>Fordjour, a double major in\nbiology and microbiology who plans to graduate in 2015, said the achievement\nrepresents another of the &#x201C;mind-blowing&#x201D; opportunities he has had since\nchoosing to attend UT Arlington.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My entire undergraduate career\nchanged after I got into research,&#x201D; said Fordjour, who moved to Irving from the\nUnited Kingdom after high school. &#x201C;So many doors have opened up to me, chances\nthat I never thought I would get.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Hurdle said the prestigious\naward reflects the dedicated work of Fordjour and his research partner Kieu\nDoan, another undergraduate in the chemistry/biochemistry department. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Emmanuel is a very promising\nscientific talent, exemplifying the high quality of students in the College of\nScience and undergraduate research participation in the Department of Biology,&#x201D;\nHurdle said. &#x201C;This honor will provide him the opportunity to shine light on a\ndisease that is hard to treat, frustrating to clinicians, causes much death and\nis now deemed an urgent public health threat by CDC. &#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Clostridium difficile<i>,</i> an intestinal bacterium also known as\nC. difficile, causes severe diarrhea and is responsible for at least 250,000\nhospitalizations and 14,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. Elderly and\nhospitalized patients are especially susceptible. Last year, the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention named C. difficile one of the three most &#x201C;urgent\ndrug resistant health threats.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>Fordjour saw firsthand the toll\nthat C. difficile could take while volunteering at Baylor Medical Center at\nIrving. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;C. difficile just stood out to\nme because it&#x2019;s a formidable pathogen. You get sick and you think you&#x2019;re done\nwith it, and it comes back,&#x201D; said Fordjour, who has volunteered 600 hours in\nthe hospital&#x2019;s emergency room. </p>\n<p>In a project overseen by Hurdle,\nFordjour and Doan tested combinations of current and in development antibiotics\nagainst clinically relevant C. difficile strains isolated from patients. He\nfound evidence that combining a currently used antibiotic called rifaximin and an\nantibiotic called fusidic acid that is still in clinical trials in the U.S. was\nparticularly effective against different strains of C. difficile in lab tests,\ngaining better results than either drug alone more than half the time.</p>\n<p>This combination could also\nreduce the risk of C. difficile developing resistance to either drug during\ntherapy, he said. The next step will be submitting those results for\npublication.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Rifaximin which is used to\ntreat traveler&#x2019;s diarrhea is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for\npatients who experience multiple episodes of treatment failures for CDI.&#xA0; The problem is that resistance can arise to\nrifaximin during treatment.&#xA0; We hope the\ncombinations showing improve efficacy over rifaximin alone, could provide a\nbetter treatment outcome,&#x201D; Hurdle said. </p>\n<p>In addition to Fordjour&#x2019;s work\nwith Hurdle, he is a member of the UT Arlington Honors College and a recipient\nof the UT System Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation, or LSAMP,\ngrant and a scholar in the Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement\nProgram. After graduation, he hopes to complete a combined M.D./Ph.D. program and become a\nphysician, educator and researcher. </p>\n<p>Ashley Purgason, assistant dean\nfor undergraduate research and student advancement in the College of Science,\nsaid Fordjour&#x2019;s success brings prestige to UT Arlington and its efforts to increase\nundergraduate research opportunities.

Teams paid these increasing salaries out of funds newly attained\nthrough television revenue. Between 1964 and 1979, revenues from television\ncontracts rose from $21 million to $54 million. </p>\n<p>During\nthis time, players and owners investigated new ways to preserve and,\neventually, enhance players&#x2019; bodies.</p>\n<p>The\npair interviewed notable sports figures such as Nolan Ryan and Bob Costas and a\nwide array of baseball players, team physicians, trainers, general managers,\nagents and union officials with careers dating back to the mid-1960s. The\narticle focuses on Sandy Koufax, Tommy John, Frank Jobe and Jos&#xE9; Canseco, who in his own book admitted to using\nperformance-enhancing drugs during his playing career. In fact, his tell-all\nclaimed that the large majority of Major League Baseball players used steroids.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Enticed\nby the prospect of riches, players and teams harnessed fitness training,\nreconstructive surgery, biomechanical analysis and performance-enhancing drugs\nto reduce wear and tear on players&#x2019; bodies and, ultimately, radically alter\nthem for profit,&#x201D; Rose and Salzmann concluded in the paper. &#x201C;This interplay\nbetween economic incentives and medicine created what we call bionic\nballplayers: bigger, stronger, and at times, more fragile than their\npredecessors.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The\nstudy suggests that the question raised by steroids is not individual morality,\nbut rather the morality produced by a political economy of labor that calls for\nboth services and body parts rendered.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Ironically,\nas Rose and Salzmann&#x2019;s article went to press, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig had\njust suspended 13 players for using steroids.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image-caption-right photocaption250\">null<figcaption>Sarah Rose, labor and disability historian in the College of Liberal Arts</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;Why\nhas professional baseball players&#x2019; steroid use been characterized as an immoral\nillegitimate bodily enhancement, when other medical interventions, such as &#x2018;Tommy\nJohn&#x2019; elbow reconstruction surgery, have been celebrated as career-saving\ncures?&#x201D; Rose questioned. &#x201C;While admittedly different, we show that both bodily\ninterventions arose out of the same dramatic shifts in the business of baseball\n&#x2013; shifts that drove the medicalization of the game and players&#x2019; bodies.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The\nresearchers contend that before the advent of salary arbitration and free\nagency, ballplayers were disposable parts in a high-risk work environment.

One of those genes, they\nalso found, may be an example of a &#x201C;slippery gene&#x201D; more prone to evolutionary\nchanges.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image-caption-left photocaption300\">null<figcaption>A research team led by John W. &quot;Trey&quot; Fondon, a UT Arlington assistant professor of biology, recently published a study on gene mutation in pigeons.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>John W. &#x201C;Trey&#x201D; Fondon, an\nassistant professor of biology, is co-author of a study that begins to unravel\nthe molecular basis for the color palette of domestic pigeons breeds known as\n&#x201C;fancy pigeons.&#x201D; Due mostly to organized breeding in Europe and Asia, there are\nhundreds of types of pigeons that have evolved to include numerous color\nvariations on the blue/black model, including shades of gray, red, and brown.</p>\n<p>The&#xA0;genes\nin the study have previously been linked to&#xA0;skin and hair color variation\namong people, as well as the development of melanoma.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The\npigeon really has been neglected as a model system, and we are changing that,&#x201D;\nFondon said, adding that such studies can help in an overall understanding of\nvertebrate systems. &#x201C;The things that shape diversity also shape disease.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The results are being published\nonline Feb. 6 in the journal <i>Current\nBiology</i>. Eric T. Domyan, a post-doctoral fellow in the lab of University of\nUtah professor Michael D. Shapiro, is lead author. </p>\n<p>Other co-authors include\nShapiro; Shreyas Krishnan and Clifford Rodgers, of UT Arlington; Zev\nKronenberg, Michael W. Guernsey, Anna Vickery and Mark Yandell, of University\nof Utah; Raymond E. Boissy, of the University of Cincinnati College of\nMedicine; and Pamela Cassidy and Sancy A. Leachman, of the Oregon Health &amp;\nScience University.</p>\n<p>Shapiro&#x2019;s team at University of\nUtah published research last year in the journal <i>Science</i> that revealed results from the first large-scale sequencing\nof the pigeon genome. That collection of more than 100 billion DNA bases from\n40 pigeons, provided the basis for the new work.</p>\n<p>Geneticists like Fondon have\nturned to dog breeds in the past to understand the molecular basis of phenotype\nchanges because dog breeds are so varied. Fondon said scientists hoping to\nunderstand more about how characteristics vary can find even greater\nstatistical power and diversity in studying domestic pigeons.</p>\n<p>Fondon&#x2019;s laboratory worked in\nparallel with researchers at Utah to find that coding and regulatory variations\nin the interactions among the genes Tyrp1, Sox10 and Slc45a2 control multiple\ncolor phenotypes, or appearances, in pigeons. For example, researchers found\nthat the ash-red mutation in Tyrp1, a gene that plays a large role in color\ndetermination, arose just once and was spread throughout the species by\nselective breeding.</p>\n<p>They also found that some color\nchanges evolved through changes in the same gene that happened at different\ntimes &#x2013; hinting at the existence of a &#x201C;slippery gene.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>Fondon&apos;s team found two\nindependent deletions of regulatory sequences near the Sox10 gene produce\n&#x201C;recessive red&#x201D; pigmentation. These mutations happened at different points in\nevolution, and researchers believe it is no coincidence they hit the same spot,\nas this same region is also deleted in color mutants of chickens and mice,\nFondon said. There are indications of yet more independent mutations of this\n&quot;hotspot.&quot; </p>\n<p>More research is needed, but\nFondon expects significant progress in understanding is on the horizon.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;These traits are falling like dominoes in\nterms of our understanding their genetic origins. It took hundreds of years to\nset them up and now they are just falling,&#x201D; Fondon said. </p>\n<p>The name of the new paper is\n&#x201C;Epistatic and combinatorial effects of pigmentary gene mutations in the\ndomestic pigeon.&#x201D; </p>\n<p>&quot;Dr.\nFondon is contributing important, essential discoveries to our understanding of\nhow genes change over time.

The publication describes using headspace gas chromatography and an ionic liquid gas chromatography column Armstrong&#x2019;s lab developed to measure moisture content in active pharmaceutical ingredients such as ibuprofen, tetracycline and ephedrine. Water content can affect the stability and shelf life of a drug and, when it is too high, cause microbial growth, according to the paper.</p>\n<p>Chromatography is the process of separating a chemical mixture to measure its components. Headspace gas chromatography, or HSGC, involves the measuring of volatile analytes, or chemical components, as they diffuse into a &#x201C;headspace&#x201D; at the top of a tube of sample, including solids. The new method combines HSGC with the use of ionic liquids. Ionic liquids consist of a mixture of positively and negatively charged molecules. They have a variety of advantages as solvents.</p>\n<p>Currently, two methods are most commonly used to measure moisture content. One is called weight loss on drying, or LOD; the other is called Karl Fischer Titration, or KFT. The newly described work from Armstrong&#x2019;s lab is useful on more types of drug ingredients than LOD and is more than 100 times more sensitive in some cases than KFT. It also can be used for much smaller samples and be automated, the paper said.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Graduate student Lillian A. Frink is lead author on the paper and Choyce A. Weatherly, also a graduate student in Armstong&#x2019;s lab, is a co-author.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We think industry will utilize this method based on its broad applicability, its high accuracy, and the sample size requirements,&#x201D; said Frink. &#x201C;It also doesn&#x2019;t have side-reactions like current methods, which make them inaccurate.&quot;</p>\n<p>Armstrong has been a leader in the characterizing and synthesizing ionic liquids. He also holds patents on several open tubular capillary gas chromatography columns that utilize ionic liquids, including those used in the current research.</p>\n<p>The newly published paper is called &#x201C;Water determination in active pharmaceutical ingredients using ionic liquid headspace gas chromatography and two different detection protocols.&#x201D; It is available here: <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561336\">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24561336.</a></p>\n<p>Armstrong joined UT Arlington in 2006 and is the author of more than 550 scientific publications, including 29 book chapters, and holds 23 U.S. and international patents.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>His lab recently made headlines when they debuted research on a new method for testing for performance enhancing drugs.

        "body": "\n<p>UT Arlington biochemists say\ntheir newly published study brings researchers a step closer to understanding\nhow the commonly used synthetic compound bisphenol-A, or BPA, may promote\nbreast cancer growth.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image-caption-left photocaption250\">null<figcaption>Mandal</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Subhrangsu Mandal, associate\nprofessor of chemistry/biochemistry, and Arunoday Bhan, a PhD student in\nMandal&#x2019;s lab, looked at a molecule called RNA HOTAIR. HOTAIR is an abbreviation\nfor long, non-coding RNA, a part of DNA in humans and other vertebrates. HOTAIR\ndoes not produce a protein on its own but, when it is being expressed or\nfunctioning, it can suppress genes that would normally slow tumor growth or cause\ncancer cell death. </p>\n<p>High levels of HOTAIR expression\nhave been linked to breast tumors, pancreatic and colorectal cancers, sarcoma\nand others.</p>\n<p>UT Arlington researchers found\nthat when breast cancer and mammary gland cells were exposed to BPA in lab\ntests, the BPA worked together with naturally present molecules, including\nestrogen, to create abnormal amounts of HOTAIR expression. Their results were\npublished online in February by the Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and\nMolecular Biology. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t immediately say BPA\ncauses cancer growth, but it could well contribute because it is disrupting the\ngenes that defend against that growth,&#x201D; said Mandal, who is corresponding\nauthor on the paper. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Understanding the developmental\nimpact of these synthetic hormones is an important way to protect ourselves and\ncould be important for treatment,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>Bhan is lead author on the new\npaper. Co-authors include Mandal lab members Imran Hussain and Khairul I\nAnsari, as well as Linda I. Perrotti, a UT Arlington psychology assistant\nprofessor, and Samara A.M. Bobzean, a member of Perrotti&#x2019;s lab.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We were surprised to find that BPA\nnot only increased HOTAIR in tumor cells but also in normal breast tissue,&#x201D;\nsaid Bhan. He said further research is needed, but the results beg the question\n&#x2013; are BPA and HOTAIR involved in tumor genesis in addition to tumor growth?</p>\n<p>BPA has been widely used in\nplastics, such as food storage containers, the lining of canned goods and,\nuntil recently, baby bottles. It belongs to a class of endocrine disrupting\nchemicals, or EDCs, which have been shown to mimic natural hormones. These\nendocrine disruptors interfere with hormone regulation and proper function of human\ncells, glands and tissue. Previous studies have linked BPA to problems with\nreproductive development, early puberty, obesity and cancers.</p>\n<p>Under normal circumstances,\nestrogen regulates HOTAIR, turning its expression on and off through\ninteraction with molecules called estrogen-receptors, or ERs, and estrogen\nreceptor-coregulators, or ER-coregulators. The new study found that BPA\ndisrupts the normal function of the ERs and the ER-coregulators when estrogen\nwas present and when it wasn&#x2019;t, potentially implicating it in tumor growth in a\nvariety of cancers. </p>\n<p>&quot;Research\nwork is at its best when results can shed light on issues of public concern.\nDr. Mandal and his team are using their expertise to do just that. Their\nfindings continue to advance what we know about how the chemicals in our\nenvironment could be affecting us in unseen ways,&quot; said Pamela\nJansma,&#xA0;dean of the UT Arlington College of Science.</p>\n<p>Researchers saw similar results when they exposed HOTAIR\nto a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbestrol (DES). DES has been shown to\nincrease risks of breast cancer and other health problems in women who used it\nand their daughters. It was formerly used as a hormone replacement and as an\nattempt to prevent pregnancy complications. </p>\n<p>The new paper is called &#x201C;Bisphenol-A\nand diethylstilbestrol exposure induces the expression of breast cancer\nassociated long noncoding RNA HOTAIR in vitro and in vivo.&#x201D; It is available\nhere: <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076014000314\">www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076014000314</a>.</p>\n<p>The National Institutes of\nHealth and American Heart Association funded Mandal&#x2019;s research into endocrine\ndisrupting chemicals.</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a\ncomprehensive research institution and the second largest institution in The\nUniversity of Texas System. <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> ranked UT\nArlington as the seventh fastest-growing public research university in 2013. <i>U.S.\nNews &amp; World Report</i> ranks UT Arlington fifth in the nation for\nundergraduate diversity.

        "body": "\n<p>A University of Texas at Arlington physicist working to create a luminescent nanoparticle to use in security-related radiation detection may have instead happened upon an advance in photodynamic cancer therapy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image-caption-left photocaption200\">null<figcaption>Wei Chen</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Wei Chen, professor of physics and co-director of UT Arlington&#x2019;s Center for Security Advances Via Applied Nanotechnology, was testing a copper-cysteamine complex created in his lab when he discovered unexplained decreases in its luminescence, or light emitting power, over a time-lapse exposure to X-rays. Looking further, he found that the nanoparticles, called Cu-Cy, were losing energy as they emitted singlet oxygen &#x2013; a toxic byproduct that is used to damage cancer cells in photodynamic therapy.</p>\n<p>Because Chen also is leading federally funded cancer research, he knew he had found something unique. Testing revealed that the Cu-Cy nanoparticles, combined with X-ray exposure, significantly slowed tumor growth in lab studies.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This new idea is simpler and better than previous photodynamic therapy methods. You don&#x2019;t need as many steps. This material alone can do the job,&#x201D; Chen said. &#x201C;It is the most promising thing we have found in these cancer studies and we&#x2019;ve been looking at this for a long time.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"image-caption-right photocaption200\">null<figcaption>Lun Ma</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Chen&#x2019;s research is being published in the August edition of the Journal of Biomedical Nanotechnology under the title &#x201C;A New X-Ray Activated Nanoparticle Photosensitizer for Cancer Treatment.&#x201D; Co-authors are Lun Ma, a research assistant professor, and Xiaoju Zou, a research associate. The paper is available online at <a href=\"http://www.aspbs.com/JBN/contents_jbn2014108.htm\">http://www.aspbs.com/JBN/contents_jbn2014108.htm</a>.</p>\n<p>The University has also filed a provisional patent application on the new complex.</p>\n<p>Photodynamic therapy, or PDT, harms cancer cells when a photosensitizer introduced into tumor tissue produces toxic singlet oxygen after being exposed to light. In some studies, this light exposure is done through use of visible or near-infrared lasers. Others have found more success by also introducing luminescent nanoparticles into the tumor. Researchers activate the luminescent nanoparticle with near-infrared light or X-rays, which in turn activates the photosensitizer.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Both methods have limitations for treating deep tissue cancers. They are either inefficient or the light source needed to activate them doesn&#x2019;t penetrate deep enough. Chen said that X-ray inducible Cu-Cy particles surpass current photosensitizers because the X-rays can penetrate deep into tissue. Also, Cu-Cy nanoparticles don&#x2019;t need other photosensitizes to be effective so the treatment is more convenient, efficient and cost-effective.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Chen&#x2019;s commitment to his work in cancer-related therapy, as well as his work in the area of homeland security, demonstrates the wide-ranging applications and great value of basic science research,&#x201D; said Carolyn Cason, vice president for research at UT Arlington. &#x201C;These advances have the potential to change the way some cancers are treated and make therapy more effective &#x2013; a benefit that would be boundless.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Chen&#x2019;s team tested the Cu-Cy on human breast and prostate cancer cells in the lab and found it to be an effective treatment when combined with X-ray exposure. In one test, for example, a tumor treated with Cu-Cy injection and X-ray exposure stayed virtually the same size over a 13-day period while a tumor without the full treatment grew by three times.</p>\n<p>Ma said: &quot;Photodynamic therapy is limited to treat superficial diseases such as skin cancer because current photosensitizers cannot be activated using high energy irradiations that are able to deeply penetrate into tissues. As a new photosensitizer, the Cu-Cy can be effectively activated by X-ray irradiation for cancer cell destruction. It may be a breakthrough to bring photodynamic therapy to deep cancer treatment.&quot;</p>\n<p>Another advantage of the new nanoparticle is a low toxicity to healthy cells. In addition, Cu-Cy&#x2019;s intense photoluminescence and X-ray luminescence can be used for cell imaging, the paper said.</p>\n<p>Details of the crystal structure and optical properties of the new complex are being published in an upcoming paper from the Journal of Materials Chemistry. It is available here: <a href=\"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2014/tc/c4tc00114a\">http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2014/tc/c4tc00114a</a>.</p>\n<p>The UT Arlington team continues to pursue photodynamic cancer therapy research under a grant from the Department of Defense Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs and with collaborations from industry. Further research will include reducing the size of the Cu-Cy nanoparticle to make it more easily absorbed in the tumor tissue.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;For cancer, there is still no good solution yet. Hopefully this nanoparticle can provide some possibilities,&#x201D; Chen said.</p>\n<p><b><span>About UT Arlington</span></b><b>&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a comprehensive research institution and the second largest institution in The University of Texas System. <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> ranked UT Arlington as the seventh fastest-growing public research university in 2013. <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> ranks UT Arlington fifth in the nation for undergraduate diversity.

BMPs are proteins known to promote bone growth. The research is detailed in a new paper, &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0093514\"><i>Tissue Engineering Bone Using Autologous Progenitor Cells in the Peritoneum</i>,</a>&#x201D; published by the online journal PLoS One.</p>\n<p>Liping Tang, UT Arlington bioengineering chair and professor, and Dr. Joseph Borrelli, chair of orthopedics for Texas Health Arlington Memorial, co-authored the paper and are lead investigators of the research project.</p>\n<p>Tang said the process will allow surgeons to establish a &#x201C;mini-bioreactor&#x201D; in a patient&#x2019;s own body. Scientists determined that the abdomen of a mouse effectively mimics the traumatic and foreign body environmental response that takes place during various bone repair procedures in humans. Bone tissue can be generated in a few days through the process, he said, rather than the weeks or months existing processes take in a lab setting.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This research will help us to formalize a specific type of scaffolding mixture that could eliminate the use of current bone grafting techniques,&#x201D; Borrelli said.</p>\n<p>The procedure could help with open bone fractures, osteomyelitis, fractures that fail to heal, congenital malformations, tumors and, in a more general sense, perhaps osteoporosis.</p>\n<p>The goal is to use the body&#x2019;s own healing capacity in bone repair, Borrelli said. For instance, today if a patient suffers from a bone defect or complex tibia fracture, a surgeon may perform an iliac crest bone graft, taking bone from the pelvis.</p>\n<p>During the bone graft procedure, the surgeon uses a mechanism that scrapes or shaves bone from the pelvis. The bone shavings are then placed directly into the defect or combined with other proteins. If successful, the research involving Borrelli and Tang will eliminate the grafting technique altogether.</p>\n<p>Borrelli said the current grafting procedure has a 25 percent complication rate. He said the new procedure will help curtail the complication rate associated with bone grafting and reduce medical costs.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In the future, a physician will be able to inject the scaffolding material with the ideal protein into the area where the patient&#x2019;s bone needs to grow or repair, and the patient&#x2019;s cells will never have to leave the body,&#x201D; Borelli said. &#x201C;It will cut down on cost. It will cut down on surgery time. It will enhance patient comfort, too.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the UT Arlington College of Engineering, said the collaboration between the hospital and the university is the kind of collaboration that can lead to innovation in health care.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Partners like Texas Health Arlington Memorial keep our researchers focused on goals that will help people,&#x201D; Behbehani said. &#x201C;The work by Dr. Tang and Dr. Borrelli holds the promise of a medical advancement that can save patients time and money and improve treatment.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The research team said the process could become an outpatient procedure in the future.</p>\n<p>Texas Health Arlington Memorial is funding $90,000 to support further research on this and other clinically relevant projects. This money will also pay for a doctoral student in Tang&#x2019;s lab.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We couldn&#x2019;t think of a better collaborative project to be a part of,&#x201D; said Kirk King, Texas Health Arlington Memorial president. &#x201C;By working with talented individuals at UT Arlington, we&#x2019;re helping advance science with the ultimate goal of enhancing health care to improve an individual&#x2019;s quality of life.

        "body": "\n<p>A\nnew study by UT Arlington researchers could lead to better language assessments\nand timelier treatment for children with language learning difficulties.</p>\n<p>Jodi\nTommerdahl, an associate professor of curriculum and instruction in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/coehp/index.php\">College\nof Education and Health Professions</a>,\nand Cynthia Kilpatrick, an assistant professor of linguistics in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/libarts/index.html\">College\nof Liberal Arts</a>, found that language concerns among children\ncould be reliably diagnosed by analyzing samples about 100 spoken words at a\ntime rather than evaluating longer samples that take more time to analyze. The\nteam argues that the shorter samples could speed up the diagnosis process and\nenable clinicians help children earlier in life.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is key because at the moment, language impairment is often\nundiagnosed. And when it is diagnosed, it&#x2019;s diagnosed later\nthan you&#x2019;d want it to be,&#x201D; Tommerdahl said.</p>\n<p>She added: &#x201C;If we can find meaningful differences in typical and atypical\nlanguage in children at age 2 instead of at age 6, we&#x2019;re just that much closer\nto developing more appropriate treatments for those kids and getting them back\non track both in the linguistic sense, but also educationally.&#x201D; The new findings are published in this month&#x2019;s journal <i>Language Testing.</i> &#xA0;</p>\n<p>For\ntheir study, the pair used a test-retest procedure to look systematically at\nthe morphology and syntax ability in 23 typically developing children between\nages 2 and 3. They set up toys, hidden cameras and microphones in a flexible, large\nroom at the University of Birmingham, U.K., which provided some funding for the\nstudy. As\neach child and parent entered the room, their interactions were recorded for\n40-minute intervals over several days within a one-week period.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>&#x201C;We\nhad very good quality in a natural play setting because most of what we know about\nchild language comes from spontaneous samples or observing children communicate\nnaturally,&#x201D; Tommerdahl said. &#x201C;Most tests involve elicited language or children\nbeing asked to do something or to respond to specific stimuli.&quot; </p>\n<p>Some researchers\nrecord in a clinic with a professional interacting with the child. The team says that using spontaneous samples, however, the children are not in a test\nsituation, not nervous, and researchers are able to see real-life language that\nchildren use on a daily basis.\n</p>\n<p>Kilpatrick said their research shows that 200 utterances is not better\nthan 100 utterances in terms of reliability within a spontaneous language\nsample, so 100 utterances might be the ultimate sample size.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Clinicians, linguists and people who work with\nlanguage samples spend a lot of time recording language samples, and you want\nthe shortest sample possible to give you the best results or most reliable\nresult that you can get,&#x201D; Kilpatrick said. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>The team&#x2019;s next step is to acquire funding to either\ndevelop or contribute to an enormous database of child language that would be\nfreely available to researchers who want to use it.&#xA0; </p>\n<p>Tommerdahl and Kilpatrick&#x2019;s new paper is called &#x201C;<a href=\"http://ltj.sagepub.com/content/31/1/3.abstract\">The\nReliability of Morphological Analyses in Language Samples</a>.&#x201D; It is also available via <a href=\"http://languagetesting.info/sage/ltb.php\">podcast</a> at the <i>Language Testing</i>\nwebsite.</p>\n<p>\n<b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About UT Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a\ncomprehensive research institution and the second largest institution in The\nUniversity of Texas System.

The research is funded through NASA&#x2019;s Living With a Star\ninitiative, which supports physics to further knowledge about the sun, its\nrelationship to the Earth and its effect on life and society.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Almost all the influence of\nspace weather on our society is affected by dynamics in the upper atmosphere. Neutral\nwind in the upper atmosphere is very difficult to model and measure but it is\nstill one of the most important parameters to consider,&#x201D; said Deng, an\nassistant professor of physics who joined UT Arlington&#x2019;s College of Science in\n2009.</p>\n<p>Solar winds (plasma) from the\nSun carry an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and energy that interacts with\nthe Earth&#x2019;s outer magnetic field, or magnetosphere. During times of greater\nsolar output, like after a coronal mass ejection (CME) or solar flare, spikes\nof energy can enter the thermosphere/ionosphere, also known as the upper\natmosphere. If not properly anticipated, the bursts can disrupt energy delivery\nsystems, communication technology and airline activity.</p>\n<p>The new four-year, $534,000\ngrant builds on a $408,000 NASA grant Deng received in 2013 to further develop\nthe Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model or GITM. &#xA0;GITM is a 3-D look at how electrodynamic\nenergy from solar winds influences the Earth&#x2019;s upper atmosphere. </p>\n<p>The system is unique because it\nis the first to incorporate the non-hydrostatic process in a circulation model for\nthe upper atmosphere. A hydrostatic environment assumes a balance between\npressure gradient force and gravitational force, which is naturally disturbed\nwhen any energy is input from space environment, Deng said. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>The GITM system also is the\nfirst model of its kind to incorporate information about acoustic wave\npropagation. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Deng&#x2019;s continued NASA\nsupport is a strong endorsement of the valuable role she is playing in pushing\npast limits in our understanding of the Earth and its atmosphere,&#x201D; said Pamela\nJansma, dean of the UT Arlington College of Science.&#xA0; &#x201C;She has forged partnerships with other\ninstitutions that are strengthening UT Arlington&#x2019;s reputation and benefiting\nthe scientific community overall.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Donald Hampton, a research\nassistant professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, and Jonathan Makela,\nan associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University\nof Illinois, are co-investigators on Deng&#x2019;s new grant and will contribute\nobservational information.

UT Arlington&#x2019;s Hispanic population has climbed steadily in recent years as total global enrollment has swelled to about 38,000 students. Hispanic enrollment stands at 25.2 percent of the University&#x2019;s 25,000 undergraduates. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>While the HSI designation does not provide institutions with a direct award, it makes them eligible for funding from specific programs and initiatives aimed at promoting academic success not only for Hispanic students but for all those enrolled at the institution. For fiscal year 2014, the total appropriation for the federal HSI Program is more than $100 million.</p>\n<p>Such grants may be used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhancement of academic offerings, program quality and institutional stability, all of which benefit the entire student population.</li>\n<li>Mentorship programs to enhance retention and graduation rates of first-generation college students.</li>\n<li>Recruitment of Hispanic students in STEM fields.</li>\n<li>Identification and recruitment of high-performance students from high school and community colleges to create a pipeline to UT Arlington.</li>\n<li>Internship opportunities.</li>\n<li>Recruitment of new international students.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>David Silva, UT Arlington vice provost for faculty affairs, guided the application process and said that the status means that the funds are applicable to their work and research needs, too.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In addition to investing in our students, the HSI designation will provide new opportunities for faculty recruitment, faculty development and early-career scholars, and for strengthening UT Arlington&#x2019;s community partnerships,&#x201D; Silva said.</p>\n<p>Robert Estrada, a UT Arlington Development Board member and chairman of Dallas-based Estrada Hinojosa &amp; Co., applauded the new designation and called it &#x201C;a critical step toward providing greater resources and opportunities for all students, including the Hispanic population.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a clear reflection of the changing demographics of the North Texas region, and I am proud to see UT Arlington pursuing available resources to serve its diverse study population,&#x201D; Estrada said. &#x201C;Diversity is part of what makes UT Arlington the world-class institution that it is, and its students and faculty are worthy of additional federal support.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Antonio Flores, president of the National Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, has said that educating Latinos is crucial to future U.S. economic stability and growth. Latinos are projected to make up a majority of the Texas population by 2020 and nearly 30 percent of the nation&#x2019;s population by 2050.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We need them to be more educated and more qualified than past generations so that we can sustain the rest of the economy and have the workforce needed to maintain our competitiveness in a global economy,&#x201D; said Flores, who spoke at UT Arlington April 16 as part of the Center for Mexican American Studies Speaker Series. &quot;We need to invest in the education and training of Latinos from the ground up, from kindergarten to 12th grade, into college and beyond.&quot;</p>\n<p>Universities must re-apply for the Hispanic-Serving Institution designation annually.
