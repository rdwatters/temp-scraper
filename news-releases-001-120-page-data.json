They also compared the behavior of several conducting polymers.</p><p>The stationary currents recorded after two hours during testing suggests that the polyaniline layer maintained its photoelectrochemical efficacy for the studied time period. While in the gas phase, only hydrogen was detected, but potential fuels such as methanol and ethanol were both detected in the solution for carbon dioxide-saturated samples.</p><p>&#x201C;Apart from these technical qualities, as a polymer, polyaniline can also be easily made into fabrics and films that adapt to roofs or curved surfaces to create the large surface areas needed for photoelectrochemical reduction, eliminating the need for expensive and dangerous solar concentrators,&#x201C; Rajeshwar added.</p><p>Frederick MacDonnell, chair of UTA&#x2019;s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, underlined the importance of this research in the context of UTA&#x2019;s focus on global environmental impact within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Rajeshwar&#x2019;s ongoing leadership in research around new materials for solar fuel generation is vital in a world where we all recognize the need to reduce the impact of carbon dioxide emissions,&#x201D; MacDonnell said. &#x201C;Finding an inexpensive, readily-available photocathode material could open up new options to create cheaper, more energy-effective solar fuel cells.&#x201D;</p><p>Rajeshwar joined the College of Science in 1983 and is a charter member of the UTA Academy of Distinguished Scholars. He is the newly appointed president of the Electrochemical Society, an organization representing the nation&#x2019;s premier researchers dedicated to advancing solid state, electrochemical science and technology.</p><p>He is an expert in photoelectrochemistry, nanocomposites, electrochemistry and conducting polymers, and has received numerous awards, including the Wilfred T. Doherty Award from the American Chemical Society and the Energy Technology Division Research Award of the Electrochemical Society. Rajeshwar earned his Ph.D. in chemistry from the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India, and completed his post-doctoral training in Colorado State University.</p><p><b>About The University of Texas at Arlington</b></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of about 55,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System. <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> ranks UTA fifth in the nation for undergraduate diversity.

Still, patients suffer varying side effects of these drugs including: fatigue, severe headaches, hypotension, dizziness, respiratory difficulty and edema. Everyone responds differently to these drugs and doctors are only supplied with a narrow acceptable range for dosages of antihypertensive drugs for a patient. However, doctors must aggressively reduce blood pressure during a hypertensive crisis, without overshooting and causing dangerously low blood pressure.</p><div><p>The project has two major goals.</p><div></div></div><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption250\"><img alt=\"Muthu Wijesundara\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/wijesundara.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Muthu Wijesundara, division head for the biomedical division at the UTA Research Institute</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>The first goal is to establish a refined process of stimulation to the sciatic nerve or its branches for optimally controlling blood pressure by fine-tuning the electrical stimulation parameters. To do this, a series of tests will produce data indicating the most effective and precise methods for electrically controlling blood pressure. This will develop a useful treatment strategy without the use of drug therapy.</p><p>&#x201C;In order to safely and precisely modulate blood pressure for patients during a perioperative cardiac procedure or hypertensive emergency, we have developed the implantable/removable Flex &#xB5;CEA, or Flexible Micro-Channel Electrode Array,&#x201D; Kim said. &#x201C;The Flex &#xB5;CEA is an interface allowing for electric stimulation for neuromodulation at specific nerves to reliably control the neuronal activities that reduce blood pressure while minimizing unwanted side effects.&#x201D;</p><div></div><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption250\"><img alt=\"Khosrow Behbehani\" id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/khosrow-behbehani.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Khosrow Behbehani, UTA professor of bioengineering</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>The second goal is to develop a closed-loop system which can automatically control blood pressure. This system will use real-time blood pressure measurements from an implantable catheter within the blood vessels to respond instantly to changes in blood pressure and keep the blood pressure within a desired range. The system would ensure less guess work of whether or not and at what level a patient will get side effects with antihypertensive drugs.</p><p>&#x201C;This is an exciting project which we hope will lead to further developments in the field of using nerve stimulation as a therapy to modulate organ system function; not just for hypertension control, but a much wider range of conditions such as diabetes, sleep apnea, chronic pain and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders,&#x201D; Wijesundara said.</p><p>The closed-loop system will allow patients to feel assured that they are receiving proper treatment for their level of cardiac illness without unknown side effects. An added benefit is that the patient incurs less expense because there are no drug-induced side-effects to rectify.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s gratifying to see that active collaborations between UTA bioengineering and UTARI continue to bear success&#x201D; said Michael Cho, chair of the UTA Department of Bioengineering. &#x201C;We all look forward to even more collaborative efforts that maximize expertise and research interests.&#x201D;</p><p>Kim&#x2019;s research interests are in early cancer detection, brain tumor migration, neuroprosthetics, and bioelectronic medicine. He has partnered with UT Southwestern Medical Center and many colleagues, including Bioengineering Professor Cheng-Jen Chuong and Electrical Engineering Associate Professor Samir Iqbal.</p><p>Behbehani is the former dean of the College of Engineering. His research interests are focused on sleep apnea diagnostics and treatment devices. He is the owner of nine patents.</p><p>Wijesundara heads up the UTARI division that looks to advance technology that applies to tissue regeneration and wound healing, drug delivery, and prosthetic devices and interfaces. Most recently, he has worked on projects that designed a rehab glove that helps stroke victims, a smart glove that delivers needed medicine to an injured hand and speeds up healing, and a smart cushion designed to prevent pressure ulcers in wheelchair users.</p><p align=\"right\"><em>-- Written by Kari Kirkham</em></p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">UT Arlington Research Institute</span></b></p><p>UTARI performs research and development that links discovery, development, and technology commercialization leading to technology-based economic development which benefits our society.

Therefore, we are adding a modified moisture barrier to stop or reduce moisture intrusion or variation into the pavement sub-base,&#x201D; Hossain said. &#x201C;We also want to add the recycled plastic pins to soil bases and retaining walls. We can achieve the same positive impact with the pins in these new areas.&#x201D;</p><p>Soil in Texas can be ever shifting.

Other projects focus on partnering with the current advocacy community to ensure that records created by post-World War II advocates of civil rights, universal design, and adaptive sports are preserved.</p><p>&#x201C;One great outcome of the conference is that simply by participating, these archivists had the chance to network, meet one another, discuss problems and issues in their special area that few archivists nationally encounter,&#x201D; said Block. &#x201C;For many, it was the first time they had met other people working on these issues.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Disability Studies is a developing interdisciplinary field. Over the last two decades, archivists have seen growing interest by scholars in the history of disability&#x200B; and disabled people, especially following the grassroots Civil Rights movement that eventually led to the passage of the <a href=\"https://www.ada.gov/\">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>.</p><p>A major problem, according to researchers, has been the development of archival collections that reflect those activities and people.</p><p>David de Lorenzo, associate director of The Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley, noted that a core group of archivists met in Berkeley last February and, &#x201C;to our great surprise, quickly came to consensus on the idea that we need to form a consortium to create a support structure, to build on each other&apos;s strengths, and to stand stronger as a group in seeking financial support.&#x201D;</p><p>Lorenzo said the group&#x2019;s first objective will be to create better access to what has already been documented in institutional silos and progress to seeking and obtaining funding for increased cataloging and digitization.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/world-map.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>The 1494 Secundi etas mundi map in the Texas Disability History Collection uses disability imagery to depict peoples at the edge of the known world.

The vision for bringing the group together was to move toward creating a single point of access to a wide-ranging number of websites representing collections from archives, museums, colleges and universities, and nonprofit organizations throughout the nation featuring historical materials on disability history.</p><p>&#x201C;I felt the diversity of representation from different institutes gave us more clout than if we tried to pursue the portal alone,&#x201D; said Joan Naturale, national reference librarian at the Rochester Institute of Technology Wallace Center.</p><p>&#x201C;It also reminded me of many different perspectives in the field, and the possibilities for sharing our knowledge and resources would do so much to educate the world.&#x201D;</p><p>Over the next nine months, the governance, digital technology, collections and preservation, communications and outreach, and education committees will all collaborate on a white paper to be submitted to the NEH in April. &#xA0;</p><p>Some aspects of the work include:</p><ul><li>Identifying existing disability history collections in archives and developing metadata tags and a glossary of disability history terms for cataloguers;</li><li>Developing a technical survey of archives and libraries about their current standards for digital materials (including accessibility) and cataloguing disability terms;</li><li>Helping to team donors with institutions willing to serve as repositories, such as UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://library.uta.edu/txdisabilityhistory/\">Texas Disability History Collection</a>;</li><li>Developing guidelines for teachers about disability history;</li><li>Surveying existing disability history curriculum materials.</li></ul><p>As the portal is developed, the Consortium hopes to help transform how people think about the history in terms of social welfare and human rights. &#x201C;As many Americans have experienced, disability can happen at any time, to anyone, at any point in the lifespan, regardless of race, class, gender, nationality, or ethnicity,&#x201D; said Block.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;We have developed all kinds of resources to facilitate the needs of individuals and families and to foster the capability of all,&#x201D; de Lorenzo said. &#x201C;Developing the tools to discover how this happened over time, its successes and wrong turns, is what the Disability History /Archives Consortium portal will help citizens, scholars, people with disabilities, and their allies to do.&#x201D;</p><p>For more information about the Disability History/Archives Consortium, contact NEH grant principal investigators Brenda McClurkin at <a href=\"mailto:mcclurkin@uta.edu\">mcclurkin@uta.edu</a> and Sarah Rose at <a href=\"mailto:srose@uta.edu\">srose@uta.edu</a>.</p><p align=\"right\"><b><i>--Written by Catherine Page</i></b></p><p align=\"right\"></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>About The University of Texas at Arlington </b></span></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of about 55,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

The work also aims to help cloud consumers purchase the right resources that best suit their needs. Department Chair Hong Jiang and Professor Jeff Lei are co-principal investigators on the project.</p><p>Che will create a model that allows mapping of customer service-level objectives into precise resource requirements at individual computing servers, independent of the servers to be used. This new abstraction is important because it will allow the model to be portable to any data center platforms and lead to guaranteed services, provable by design. It will give service providers the ability to develop service-level-objective guaranteed service packages based on customer needs.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;This model can also benefit cloud customers.&#x201D; Che said, &#x201C;Today&#x2019;s cloud service providers mainly provide resource-centric services to their customers, offering hardware and software resources only, leaving the hard question to the customer themselves to deal with. For example, how many resources are needed to meet the service-level objectives. With our model, the customers will be able to know exactly what and how much resources need to be purchased to meet their needs.</p><p>&#x201C;This approach should provide important insights into computer systems and architecture designs with an eye toward performance guarantees, cost-effectiveness and better utilization of resources.&#x201D;</p><p>Jiang says that the grant is an excellent example of UTA&#x2019;s emphasis on <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a> contained within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/index.php\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Consumer demand for online services, especially cloud computing, are growing exponentially,&#x201D; Jiang said. &#x201C;It is imperative that providers are able to guarantee performance for their customers, and also that the providers can minimize the demand on their data center resource utilization.&#x201D;</p><p>Che joined UTA in 2002 following a brief tenure as a systems architect in private industry and two years as an assistant professor and adjunct professor at Pennsylvania State University. His research focuses on network architecture and network resource management, performance analysis of large-scale distributed computing systems, including many-core processors, warehouse-scale computing and cloud computing.</p><p>Several other UTA <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/\">College of Engineering</a> faculty also are working on research related to data-driven discovery, including:</p><ul><li>Heng Huang in computer science and engineering has earned several grants totaling nearly $5 million for his work in big data analysis for applications related to Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and depression, and precision medicine.</li><li>Junzhou Huang in computer science and engineering is working to discover a process by which image-omics data can be combined into files that are small enough that current computing technology will allow scientists to better predict how long a patient will live and how best to treat that patient.</li><li>Ioannis Schizas in <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/ee/\">electrical engineering</a> is working to develop a framework for a network of simple sensors that could be as powerful as a supercomputer, but smaller and less costly.</li></ul><p align=\"right\"><i>&#x2014; Written by Jeremy Agor</i></p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of about 55,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Nguyen will be honored at the Materials Research Society conference Nov. 27 to Dec. 2 in Boston, Mass.</p><p>Elsevier is a world-leading provider of information solutions and publisher of more than 2,500 journals and 35,000 book titles.</p><p>&#x201C;It is an honor to receive the first Embracing Challenge Award,&#x201D; Nguyen said. &#x201C;I have faced many challenges in my life, and I know I am a survivor because of those hardships, which helped me become who I am.&#x201D;</p><p>Although she works in bioengineering, Nguyen&#x2019;s research in nanomaterials &#x2013; specifically nanocomposites and nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery, hydrogels and scaffolds for tissue engineering &#x2013; relates directly to materials science and engineering.</p><p>Khosrow Behbehani, former dean of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/\">College of Engineering</a> and the man who hired Nguyen as former chair of the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/bioengineering/\">Bioengineering Department</a>, lauded the accomplishment.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Nguyen is very deserving of the Embracing Challenge Award. To endure the hardships that she has faced, then to become a top researcher in her field shows the fortitude of her spirit, and UTA is indeed fortunate to have her on the faculty,&#x201D; he said.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.materialstoday.com/council/\">The Materials Science Council</a>, chaired by Professor Subra Suresh, former director of the National Science Foundation and current president of Carnegie Mellon University, selected the winner based on her achievements and the challenges she overcame in realizing these achievements. The prize includes a $5,000 prize and all-expenses-paid attendance at the award reception.</p><p>The council was impressed with the way Professor Nguyen overcame several challenges during her formative years and the challenges she faced here, too. Most recently, she managed to successfully balance family life with an active research and teaching career.</p><p>&#x201C;Kytai&#x2019;s story really stood out from the nominations, and the Materials Science Council were unanimous in their decision to award her,&#x201D; Suresh said. &#x201C;Not only has she been a pioneer in the development of nanoparticles for controlled drug delivery and tissue engineering application but she achieved this having overcome substantial obstacles. We hope that this award will inspire other researchers who are facing challenges to see what can be achieved when working in and overcoming difficult circumstances.&#x201D;</p><p>Nguyen was born in Saigon, South Vietnam and was 11 years old when the Vietnam War ended. Her father worked in the medical field alongside doctors from around the world, including the United States. When the Communist Party took control of South Vietnam after the war, the police routinely seized homes and property from those who had been wealthy or who had not supported North Vietnam during the war, then shipped them to the country&#x2019;s farm region or mountains to learn the value of labor. Nguyen&#x2019;s family chose to relocate to a farm, where Nguyen worked in the fields, often carrying buckets of harvested rice, sweet potatoes and vegetables, or water on a yoke over her shoulders. She attended high school and earned excellent grades, but was not accepted to a single university due to her family situation.</p><p>In 1987, on her third attempt, Nguyen escaped Vietnam and made her way to Thailand and the Philippines before arriving in the United States in 1989, learning English along the way. She worked as a tutor, a research assistant and a dish washer in the cafeteria at the University of Minnesota while pursuing her bachelor&#x2019;s degree in chemical engineering. She earned her doctoral degree in chemical engineering from Rice University in 2000, just 13 years after leaving Vietnam.</p><p>Nguyen also has battled cultural stereotypes. As an Asian woman, she was not expected to advance. Juggling family life and an active career in research has been difficult because of what is expected of her culturally.</p><p>Nguyen has established herself as a leader in the field of nanomaterials, as well as a voice for minority students.</p><p>Her active research grants include:</p><ul><li>A $1.4 million National Institutes of Health grant to create a nanoparticle system to shore up arterial walls following angioplasty and stenting procedures to treat coronary arterial disease;</li><li>$440,000 of a $3.4 million National Institutes of Health grant to help a colleague at UT Southwestern develop a nanoparticle drug delivery system that will help stimulate lung growth and function after partial lung removal or destructive lung disease;</li><li>funding as part of a consortium led by UT El Paso that hopes to expose underprivileged and minority undergraduate students to research early in their academic careers and increase their chances of continuing their education beyond a bachelor&#x2019;s degree.</li></ul><p>Nguyen&#x2019;s work is indicative of projects that expand <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a> as outlined in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/communities.php\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p><p>Nguyen joined UTA&#x2019;s Bioengineering Department in 2005 and was promoted to full professor in 2015.

The official groundbreaking is scheduled for late October.</p><p>This new modern glass and steel structure will provide a new, iconic southern entry to the UTA campus. The project will add 900 teaching seats in lecture halls and classrooms, which will support enrollment growth across campus, especially the planned growth in the College of Engineering, the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, and the College of Science.</p><p>Duane Dimos, UTA vice president for research, said the SEIR building will serve as an inspiration point for students and also as a visually grand entrance at the southern edge of the campus.</p><p>&#x201C;We want the building and especially the ideas that spring from the SEIR to positively impact the health and wellness of our community and society in general,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;What is taught in the building will represent everything from the basic understanding of science, technology, engineering and mathematics to research results that will transform the world in line with the goals of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.&#x201D;</p><p>In addition, University students, faculty, staff and visitors can see the new Career Development Center, extending from the eastern edge of the University Center.</p><p>The center will be a next-generation hub for students and alumni seeking jobs and the marketable skills today&#x2019;s employers seek in their workforce. It will serve those students and alumni as a resource for resume writing, sharpening interview skills, networking, job searches and salary negotiation, and will do so from the beginning of the UTA experience through to graduation and beyond.</p><p>The center also will serve as a conduit for employers seeking job candidates, student internship applicants and a link to the vibrant, freshly minted workforce.</p><p>On the west side of campus, two antiquated apartment complexes were leveled to make way for temporary parking. Those two parking plots eventually could become future academic space according to the University&#x2019;s master plan.</p><p>Other older apartment buildings on the campus, north of the university center and at south end of the campus by West Mitchell and South Pecan streets also will be removed.&#xA0; Once removed, adjacent surface parking lots will be expanded to address parking spaces that will be lost with planned construction.</p><p>Across Nedderman Drive, the parking lot north of the Maverick Activities Center will eventually house a new 500-bed residence hall to be constructed in mid to late spring. That complex will be located on the southwest corner of the MAC parking lot. The $30.8 million facility is scheduled to open in fall 2018.</p><p>Phase 2 of the west side construction project includes another planned 500-bed residence hall erected in the northwest corner of that MAC parking lot.</p><p>For students, the new residence halls will translate to a living/learning environment similar to Vandergriff Hall.</p><p>&#x201C;The new room designs will be very similar to Vandergriff Hall but these are double occupancy rooms versus the suites in Arlington Hall and Kalpana Chawla Hall,&#x201D; said John Hall, UTA vice president for administration and campus operations. &#x201C;The double occupancy rooms are in the greatest demand by our students as many prefer the more social interaction these rooms provide versus the private bedroom suites.&#x201D;</p><p>UTA now has about 5,200 students living on campus and another 5,000 living within the general campus vicinity.</p><p>Construction of a west side dining hall facility will begin in the spring as well with that $21 million facility scheduled to open in the fall of 2018. The dining facility will feature an open concept with natural lighting and will include a student union space on the second floor.</p><p>A 1,500-car parking garage to support all the residence halls is anticipated to open in the northeast corner of that MAC parking lot in fall 2017 to accommodate projected growth of the university.</p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of about 55,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Kel Seliger, R-Amarillo, chairman of the Texas Senate Education Committee, commended UTA for graduating its students with the second lowest debt burden in the nation, an achievement that aligns with the state&#x2019;s new higher education plan, <a href=\"http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/reports/PDF/6862.PDF\">60x30TX</a>, which includes the goal that by the year 2030, undergraduate student loan debt will not exceed 60 percent of first-year wages for graduates of Texas public institutions.</p><p>&#x201C;UTA continues to be a leader in providing students access to a high quality education, while also ensuring students graduate with the least amount of debt possible,&#x201D; Seliger said. &#x201C;This overarching goal both at the state and national level is important as we continue to look at ways to improve access and affordability to higher education in Texas.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>Based on data reported to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, UTA had the lowest level of state appropriations at $11,472 per degree compared to the average of $23,611 per degree of the rest of the universities in the research and emerging research categories, emphasizing its ability to provide a top-notch education at a very high level of efficiency focusing on outcomes.&#xA0; &#xA0;</p><p>In compiling its ranking, <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> reviewed graduates of the class of 2015 and surveyed the accompanying debt loads. The data includes loans taken out by students from the colleges, from financial institutions such as banks, and from federal, state and local governments. Loans from parents and other private parties were not factored into the survey. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>UTA&#x2019;s Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships offers a wide variety of scholarships, grants, work-study and loan programs to assist with funding the college education of students and families of all income levels. In addition to the Financial Aid Office, UTA provides money management resources through its <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/business-affairs/smmc/\">Student Money Management Center</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;We help students try to steer clear of the landmines that can lead to unmanageable debt,&#x201D; said Shakeela Hunter, director of the Student Money Management Center. &#x201C;Our one-on-one counseling sessions, seminars and presentations help educate students on budgeting, saving and credit awareness and these same skills apply when they later enter the workforce.&#x201D;</p><p>Review the complete 2017 &#x201C;Best Colleges&#x201D; rankings at <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com\">www.usnews.com</a>.</p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of about 55,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

The event focused on leaders who organize makerspace events across the U.S.</p><p>Makerspace is defined as a community-operated work space where people with common interests in computers, machines, technology, science, digital art and other areas, meet, socialize and collaborate on projects. Fab Labs began as an outreach project from the Center for Bits and Atoms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. UTA&#x2019;s FabLab, located in the UTA Central Library, is the first MIT-affiliated FabLab at a university in Texas.</p><p>Discussions addressed legal structures for nonprofit organizations, methods for measuring benefits to the community, ways to cope with burnout, devices for maintaining diversity and inclusion, and plans for developing mentorships within organizations and other issues.</p><p>Congressman Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth, applauded UTA for its invitation to the White House, and for promoting making, which provides students access to technology, excellent educational opportunities, and creative exchange under the FabLab initiative.</p><p>&#x201C;UTA is at the forefront of STEM innovation in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex,&#x201D; Veasey said. &#x201C;Through the University&#x2019;s FabLab, students have access to an environment that enhances their creative spirit and provides the tools they need to have a competitive edge in the job market of tomorrow. UTA&#x2019;s invitation to the White House showcases the university&#x2019;s mission to be the catalyst of innovation.&#x201D;</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/nation-of-makers.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Among other top schools participating in the event were Stanford, Boston University and Rutgers.

Welch Chair in Chemistry and an internationally recognized scientist ranked No.8 in the Top 100 most influential people in analytical science by <i>The Analytical Scientist</i>.</p><p>&#x201C;My research at UTA in gas chromatography and separation science led directly to my job at ExxonMobil, where I continue to do the same kind of work,&#x201D; Frink said.&#xA0;</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption450\"><img alt=\"Research Expenditures by source\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/fy-2016-research-expenditures-pie-chart-update.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Research Expenditures by source</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Duane Dimos, vice president for research and dean of graduate studies, emphasized that UTA intends to continue expanding its graduate programs and encourage more students to pursue doctorate degrees across a wide variety of disciplines.</p><p>&#x201C;An abundance of graduate teaching assistant and graduate research assistant positions allows Ph.D. students to get their degrees and to be paid a stipend while doing so,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s graduate students find that their earning power, options, and opportunities are substantially increased when they earn these higher degrees.&#x201D;</p><p>In 2016, UTA was also named to the elite group of R-1: Highest Research Activity universities by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, the definitive list for the top doctoral granting research universities in the United States.</p><p>&#x201C;We are putting a real focus on developing cutting-edge interdisciplinary research proposals and have had very good success with national sponsorship agencies, especially the National Institutes for Health, where we were awarded numerous new grants this year,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;This strategy forms part of our increasing teaching and research focus on the theme of &#xA0;Health and the Human Condition within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact</a>.&#x201D;</p><p>Other theme areas being strengthened within UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan are sustainable urban communities, global environmental impact and data-driven discovery. In late October, UTA will break ground on the 220,000-square-foot Science and Engineering Innovation and Research building, which will support significant growth of students in areas of workforce need and provide the basis for enhanced interdisciplinary research activity across all areas of the Strategic Plan.</p><p>&#x201C;We designed this building with glass interior walls to enable work in the collaborative lab spaces visible to the different research teams and also to first-year students, a concept called &#x2018;science on display&#x2019;,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;This should further encourage interdisciplinary work among faculty and also enable younger students to visualize the opportunity that research could offer.&#x201D;</p><p>Rep. Chris Turner (D-Grand Prairie) congratulated the university&#x2019;s administrators on these new successes.</p><p>&#x201C;UTA is an important driver of the economic vitality of North Texas,&#x201D; Turner said. &#x201C;North Texas needs more Tier 1 universities to support our rapid growth and workforce needs, and we expect UTA will shortly join that elite group.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption500\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/uta-image-001.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>UTA student doing research</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Another important factor for future success is faculty excellence. UTA&#x2019;s faculty already count among them three members of the National Academy of Sciences and National Academy of Engineering, and 13 fellows of the National Academy of Inventors, the largest number for a Texas University and the second largest in the U.S.</p><p>To support this expansion in students and research activity, UTA is hiring new star faculty at the highest rate of any public university in the nation, with a cohort of more than 60 entering this fall semester, and plans to continue hiring over the next year.</p><p>Several of the new faculty received substantial external funding to start their research at UTA from different state entities, including:</p><ul><li>Zui Pan, a noted Ohio State University College of Medicine esophageal cancer researcher, who joined UTA&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation in August. Pan&#x2019;s appointment was made possible in part by a grant from the University of Texas System Science and Technology Acquisition and Retention, or STARs, program.</li><li>Star cell biology researcher Mark Pellegrino, who joined UTA as an assistant biology professor in August. A $823,067 grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas helped recruit Pellegrino from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.</li></ul><p>Other leading new faculty entering this fall include:</p><ul><li>Teresa Taber Doughty, dean of the College of Education, who sits on the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation Board of Visitors and was on the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education Board of Examiners from 2011-2015.</li><li>Peter Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering, who led major growth in the engineering schools at the University of Hawai&#x2018;i at M&#x101;noa&#xA0;and Arizona State University, where he earned industry support from major companies like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman Corp. and Motorola.</li><li>Scott Palmer, professor and chair in the History Department. His research includes the nexus of linking technological innovation, political authority, and the arts in Russian&#x2019;s Imperial and Soviet eras.</li><li>Kwangho Nam, assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. His research focus is on chemical thermodynamics, structural biology, biophysics and theoretical chemistry.

In order to prevent the tumor growth or provide complete tumor resolution without surgery, chemotherapy and radiation are currently in clinical practice.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Yaowu Hao \" src=\"/news/images/yaowu-hao-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"350\"><figcaption>Yaowu Hao,&#xA0;associate professor in the UTA Materials Science and Engineering Department, has received a National Institutes of Health grant to develop&#xA0;radiotherapeutic nanoseeds that will aid cancer treatment.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Unfortunately, severe adverse side effects are usually associated with these therapeutic methods. Since these tumors are already locally advanced or have begun to metastasize, the outlook today for these cancer patients is bleak and survival rate remains very low.</p><p>Yaowu Hao, an associate professor in the Materials Science and Engineering Department at The University of Texas at Arlington, has earned a three-year, $477,000 R15 grant from the <a href=\"https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?icde=0&amp;aid=9171891\">National Institutes of Health</a> to develop radiotherapeutic nanoseeds that will work from inside inoperable solid tumors and cause less damage to healthy cells.</p><p>The research also was featured in a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4745015/\">Scientific Reports</a> paper published earlier this year titled &#x201C;Theranostic Nanoseeds for Efficacious Internal Radiation Therapy of Unresectable Solid Tumors.&#x201D;</p><p>Inoperable solid tumors are often targeted with radiation. One way of applying the radiation is to surgically implant a 2-millimeter-by-5-millimeter &#x201C;seed&#x201D; with therapeutic isotopes into the tumor. Two millimeters is about seven one-hundredths of an inch.</p><p>This procedure is highly invasive and can only be used in certain parts of the body &#x2013; usually the prostate &#x2013; because of the damage caused by the implantation process and the fact that a foreign object remains inside the patient&#x2019;s body after treatment.</p><p>Instead, Hao has developed biocompatible nanoseeds that are injectable with a very small needle and cause limited trauma to surrounding tissue. Because the nanoseeds are injectable, they can be used in tumors in other areas of the body, such as the brain, lungs and liver.</p><p>&#x201C;Our main breakthrough is the development of uniquely coated gold nanoparticles that act as a carrier for the radioactive isotopes,&#x201D; Hao said. &#x201C;We chose gold because it is inert and biocompatible. The nanoseed is about 100 nanometers in size, so it is small enough to be injected in solution but large enough that it will not spread out of the tumor.&#x201D;</p><p>This type of radiation therapy is highly effective in attacking a tumor, but is also safer for the surrounding tissue because the radiation is contained within the tumor.</p><p>Hao said another benefit is that because the seeds are injectable, it is much easier to control the radiation dosages.</p><p>Stathis Meletis, chair of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/mse\">Materials Science and Engineering Department</a>, says that Hao&#x2019;s grant is an excellent example of UTA&#x2019;s emphasis on <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a> contained within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/index.php\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Hao has discovered a breakthrough in cancer treatment that could have far-reaching benefits. This grant will allow him to build upon his preliminary results and develop a treatment method that is aggressive and effective in eliminating tumors,&#x201D; Meletis said.</p><p>Hao joined UTA in 2005 following a postdoctoral fellowship at Johns Hopkins University. His research focuses on synthesis, characterization and applications of metal and magnetic nanostructures.</p><p>Several other UTA engineering faculty are also working on cancer-related research, including:</p><ul><li>Samir Iqbal in electrical engineering and bioengineering has developed a novel cancer cell detection method that will improve early diagnosis through a tool that tracks cellular behavior in real time using nanotextured walls that mimic layers of body tissue.</li><li>Liping Tang in bioengineering is using tissue-engineered artificial lymph nodes to attract prostate cancer cells to better target and eradicate the disease. He is also part of a team including researchers from UTA&#x2019;s College of Science, UT Southwestern and MD Anderson Cancer Center that is developing a multifunctional platform that can integrate imaging and photo-induced cancer therapy in a single, portable device.</li><li>Kytai Nguyen in bioengineering developed a novel cancer cell-selective nanoparticle system that can both target for imaging and drug delivery to detect and cure prostate cancer.</li><li>J.-C.

However, research has shown that many secondary school mathematics teachers lack a deep understanding of some of the mathematical concepts they teach, in part because many undergraduate mathematics courses do not offer opportunities for teachers to deeply study these concepts. There are few curricular resources available for use in college mathematics courses designed to train future secondary mathematics teachers.</p><p>&#x201C;This project is important because we aim to develop course materials in ways that can deepen teachers&#x2019; understanding of the mathematics they will teach; hence the project has the potential to positively impact both secondary school mathematics teachers and, in turn, the students they teach,&#x201D; Rhoads said.</p><p>As a first step for the project, the UTA mathematicians brought in a prestigious group of math education research and practitioner experts in mid-July to provide feedback on the current course materials, including Olive Chapman, board member for the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and editor of the Journal of Mathematics Teacher Education; Elizabeth Burroughs, chair of the Mathematical Association of America&#x2019;s committee on the Mathematical Education of Teachers; and Jennifer Hylemon, K-12 director of mathematics at Grapevine-Colleyville ISD and vice-president of the Board of Directors for the Conference for the Advancement of Mathematics Teaching.</p><p>&#x201C;This will help us identify the most important research-based aspects on teachers&#x2019; understandings of functions that need to be addressed in addition to those already identified by me in preliminary pilot classroom studies after having taught from the materials three times,&#x201D; Epperson said. &#x201C;These materials have been used at all 43 UTeach institutions and all sites are required to use them in their first year of implementation. Many universities continue to use the materials and our project, once finalized, will be a natural starting point for dissemination nationwide across the UTeach network.&#x201D;</p><p>The researchers are using feedback received from the panel of experts to make small changes for implementation this fall as well as to create an assessment that will provide information regarding the effectiveness of the materials at addressing key concepts, Epperson said. This fall they will collect data and then analyze the data next spring to begin making research-based changes to the materials. An advisory board composed of math education researchers and school supervisor leaders, UTeach Institute representatives and others, will guide the external evaluation of products developed by the researchers. &#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;After feedback is received, changes will be made next summer and the process will repeat in Fall 2017,&#x201D; Epperson said. &#x201C;In Spring 2018, after analyzing all data collected, we will again revise and create materials as well as draft the instructor notes. In Fall 2018, we will study the use of the materials at various sites as well as study how a novice instructor uses the materials. These materials focus on inquiry-based learning; many instructors have never learned in this type of setting and may not know how to implement mathematical tasks and explorations that are meant to be used in this manner.&#x201D;</p><p>The project builds upon curriculum development and research which Epperson has conducted for the last two decades. The creation of research- and standards-based materials has a natural connection to recent joint work by Epperson and Rhoads on high-yield mathematical tasks for teachers, as well as to research conducted by Epperson on strengthening problem solving for in-service mathematics teachers, and to work done by Jorgensen and Epperson as part of UTA&#x2019;s Mathematics Teacher Preparation Academy.</p><p>Epperson earned his doctorate in mathematics from UT Austin in 1996 and came to UTA in 2001. He received the UTA Innovation in Teaching Award in 2009 and the UTA Provost&#x2019;s Research Excellence Award each year from 2005-10. He is a recipient of the UT System Regents&#x2019; Outstanding Teaching Award in 2010 and the Mathematical Association of America Texas Section Award for Distinguished College or University Teaching of Mathematics in 2012, and he was named to the UTA Academy of Distinguished Teachers in 2012.</p><p>Jorgensen earned her doctorate in mathematics from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 2000 and came to UTA in 2002. She received the UTA Provost&#x2019;s Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2005, the UTA Honors College Distinguished Faculty Award in 2006, and the UT System Regents&#x2019; Outstanding Teaching Award in 2010. She was named a member of the UTA Academy of Distinguished Teachers in 2016.</p><p>Rhoads earned her doctorate in education from Rutgers University in 2014 and came to UTA as a visiting assistant professor that same year. She has conducted extensive research in mathematics education, including ongoing projects funded by the NSF and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board which focus on mathematical problem solving and representational connections in algebraic reasoning.</p><p align=\"right\">-&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; By Greg Pederson, contributing writer</p><p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>About The University of Texas at Arlington</b></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of about 55,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

        "body": "<p>After years of studying the effects of near-infrared light on veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries, a team led by a University of Texas at Arlington bioengineer has published groundbreaking research in Nature&#x2019;s <i>Scientific Reports </i>that could result in an effective, long-term treatment for brain disorders.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Hanli Liu\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/hanli-liu-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Hanli Liu, UTA bioengineering professor, has helped write two academic papers that show the positive effects of near infrared light on the brain.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Professor Hanli Liu was the primary investigator on the project. Her team of graduate students and a research associate, Fenghua Tian, worked with co-investigators Alexa Smith-Osborne, a UTA social work associate professor; Francisco Gonzalez-Lima, a psychology professor at UT Austin; and Fu Lye Martin Woon, a former assistant professor of psychiatry at UT Southwestern; to show potential intervention using light in brain disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>Their research is funded in part by a UT System BRAIN or Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies seed grant titled, &#x201C;Transcranial light therapy and imaging of prefrontal cognition in PTSD.&#x201D;</p><p>With the UT System&#x2019;s support, Liu&#x2019;s interdisciplinary collaborative team has not only investigated the brain imaging capability of light but also revealed the therapeutic rationale for potentially improving cognitive functions of patients with PTSD. The first paper resulting from the seed funding is published online and titled, &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305826487_Interplay_between_up-regulation_of_cytochrome-c-oxidase_and_hemoglobin_oxygenation_induced_by_near-infrared_laser\">Interplay between up-regulation of cytochrome-c-oxidase and hemoglobin oxygenation induced by near-infrared laser</a>.&#x201D;</p><p>As in the first study, the team used a human forearm as a biological model instead of the human brain to avoid confounding factors due to such anatomical structures as the scalp and skull. The paper outlines their discovery that shining near-infrared light on the subject&#x2019;s forearm increases production of cytochrome-c-oxydase, a protein inside the neurons that stimulates blood flow. This discovery shows great potential that NIR or infrared light also will work within the brain.</p><p>&#x201C;This is the first time that effects of light stimulation have been quantified on living human tissue,&#x201D; Liu said. &#x201C;The next challenge is to apply what was learned in a simpler system to the brain, where the light must pass through the scalp and the skull, as well as the brain. In the past several years, we have used the knowledge gained in the NIR field to detect, monitor and understand certain brain disorders, such as PTSD. But we have never utilized NIR light for treatment.&#x201D;</p><p>Now the team is moving to report and publish its findings of transcranial NIR stimulation on the human brain by quantifying production of cytochrome-c-oxydase and increase of blood flow. It would support a novel, non-invasive treatment with imaging ability, especially for memory, which could really help veterans who suffer from PTSD.</p><p>The UT BRAIN initiative was approved by the UT System Board of Regents in 2014 and supports a virtual UT System Neuroscience and Neurotechnology Research Institute that promotes trans-disciplinary, multi-institutional research projects focused on neuroscience and neurotechnology. It has provided a total of $5 million with a $100,000 per grant in a 2-year period of Sept.1, 2015 to Aug. 31, 2017.</p><p>Eight days prior to that paper, Liu and her team published another paper in <i>Scientific Reports</i>, titled, &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305643176_Prefrontal_responses_to_Stroop_tasks_in_subjects_with_post-traumatic_stress_disorder_assessed_by_functional_near_infrared_spectroscopy\">Prefrontal responses to Stroop tasks in subjects with post-traumatic stress disorder assessed by functional near infrared spectroscopy</a>.&#x201D;</p><p>That paper outlined Liu&#x2019;s work to understand how the brains of people suffering from PTSD are different from a healthy group of non-PTSD sufferers using a Stroop test.</p><p>Stroop tests are attention tests that are commonly used in psychology.</p><p>Liu measured blood flow in the left side of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex of subjects&#x2019; brains and found that those suffering from PTSD don&#x2019;t have the ability to pay attention and also have insufficient blood flow in that area of the brain.</p><p>Michael Cho, chair of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/be\">Bioengineering Department</a>, says that Liu&#x2019;s continuing focus on using NIR light to detect, monitor and potentially treat brain injuries underscores the UTA&#x2019;s focus on <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a> contained within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/index.php\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Liu and her collaborators have made incredible strides in identifying how the brain is affected by trauma, as well as how to treat disorders such as PTSD noninvasively with light,&#x201D; Cho said. &#x201C;This is truly innovative, groundbreaking research, and the results are a testament to Hanli and the input of her collaborators.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu, a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and a member of the UTA Academy of Distinguished Scholars, joined UTA&#x2019;s College of Engineering in 1996 and has secured more than $11 million as principal investigator or co-PI in research funding during her career. Her work is focused on medical instrumentation and imaging, minimally invasive and noninvasive spectroscopy and imaging of tissue, optical diffuse imaging for cancer prognosis, and brain activities.</p><p>She has studied PTSD extensively with Smith-Osborne and Tian, and they have applied a portable brain-mapping device that allows them to &#x201C;see&#x201D; where memory fails student veterans with PTSD. That research led the team to connect with Gonzalez-Limam and further discovered that shining low-level light on the brain by placing the light source on the forehead can stimulate and energize neurons to function more effectively. When cells are stimulated with light, they remain stimulated for a lengthy period of time even after the light is removed. The approach differs from other therapies that use magnets or electric shocks and has the potential to yield effective, longer-lasting treatments.</p><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><i>&#x2014; Written by Jeremy Agor</i></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of about 55,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

The research outcomes will create and establish art therapy workshops (a program) to be used as a model for other universities in Texas and beyond.</p><ul><li><b>Humanities GIS: Deep Mapping Health, the Human Condition and Climate Change in the American Southwest and Sub-Saharan Africa&#xA0;</b></li></ul><p>Charles Travis and Andrew Milson (UTA Department of History) and James Ogude and Amanda Dupreez (University of Pretoria, South Africa) will conduct a cross-cultural and comparative study of emerging research strategies to address health, the human condition, climate change and social conflict issues in the American southwest and central South African regions. By employing STEAM perspectives to explore the integration of literary, cultural, historical and environmental studies, with humanities GIS, the team will explore medical, environmental and digital humanities methodologies. The team will apply this exploration to develop digital deep mapping applications combining public health, epidemiological and Big Data studies.</p><ul><li><b>From Cure to Care: Expanding the Texas Disability History Collection&#xA0;</b></li></ul><p>Sarah Rose and Gerald Saxon (History) and Brenda McClurkin (UTA Special Libraries Collections) propose to expand the recently released Texas Disability History Collection beyond its current focus on UTA-related history. This work is crucial in order to apply for major archival processing and digitization grants and will enable researchers to begin actively incorporating Texas into national narratives about disability history and, in particular, disability rights.</p><ul><li><b>Perceptions of HPV Pharmaceutical Marketing Messages Among College-Youth&#xA0;</b></li></ul><p>The burden and cost of HPV-associated disease and cancer remain an important public health problem. Reducing the burden of HPV-associated cancer and disease through vaccination requires an integrated approach that includes clinical medicine, public health, and public policy.

Center for Disease Control statistics show that about 11 percent of American children ages 4 to 17 have Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. That is an increase of 42 percent of children diagnosed with ADHD in just the last eight years, according to the CDC.</p><p>Makedon, who is the principal investigator and a Jenkins-Garrett Distinguished Professor, said the project uses the latest methods in computer vision, machine learning and data mining to assess several children while they are performing certain physical and computer exercises that are designed to produce executive function skills, and involve attention, decision-making and managing emotions. The data collected is then analyzed to generate recommendations for the best type of intervention.</p><p>&#x201C;We believe that the proposed computational methods will help provide quantifiable early diagnosis and allow us to monitor progress over time. In particular, it will help children overcome learning difficulties and lead them to healthy and productive lives. Working with top neuroscientists and psychology experts, our aim is to develop new computer methods to help discover problems with the underlying neurocognitive processes,&#x201D; Makedon said. &#x201C;The goal is to design low-cost, easy-to-use systems that can be implemented in special education practices world-wide.&#x201D;</p><p>Makedon said that the proposed system builds upon many years of expertise and a track record of a strong interdisciplinary team.</p><p>&#x201C;It also builds upon a large existing education program that was designed by psychiatry experts, our Yale collaborators,&#x201D; she said.</p><p>During the past five years, the Makedon and Athitsos team has received three other large NSF grants which have built the computational foundation for this award.</p><p>At the heart of the project is a computer vision recognition and machine learning system that assesses children while they&#x2019;re performing certain physical and computer exercises. The data collected is analyzed to recognize patterns of inattention, hyperactivity or acting impulsively, two features common to executive function disorders, including ADHD. Monitoring and analyzing how children are behaving during such game-like exercises can be used to build a knowledge base that will enable health-care professionals to apply predictive methods and make recommendations for effective intervention.</p><p>Hong Jiang, chair of the Computer Science and Engineering Department, said this research is yet another example of the power of computer science in addressing real-world problems to empower the experts in making targeted decisions and providing for personalized intervention.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Makedon is leading breakthrough research, building human-centric innovations that can be widely applied to improving the quality of life at home or the workplace, especially for people with special physical or cognitive needs,&#x201D; Jiang said. &#x201C;This award now opens the door for larger funding efforts in areas that use evidence-based, data-driven approaches to improve the human condition, a priority of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.&#x201D;</p><p>Makedon directs the <a href=\"http://heracleia.uta.edu/\">HERACLEIA Human Centered Laboratory</a> and the Motion Capture Lab, both of which support research in pervasive technologies for human monitoring. She currently supervises 12 doctoral students, several master&#x2019;s students and a high number of undergraduate students funded through the NSF. Since joining UTA in 2006, she graduated seven doctoral students.</p><p>Currently, she is director of an NSF <a href=\"http://iperform.uta.edu/\">iPerform I/UCRC Center</a> that focuses on working with industries to develop computer-based innovations that enhance human performance at all levels. She also is a member of several journal editorial boards and chair of the PETRA international conference (<a href=\"http://www.petrae.org)\">www.petrae.org)</a> sponsored by UTA and NSF. Makedon has received more than $5 million in NSF and other grants during the last several years.</p><p>Makedon was a professor at Dartmouth College for nearly 17 years before coming to UTA. She directed the Dartmouth Experimental Visualization Lab.&#xA0;</p><p>Athitsos focuses on computer vision, machine learning and data mining. He has established the Vision-Learning-Mining or <a href=\"http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/vlm\">VLM research lab</a>. He is a recipient of the prestigious NSF CAREER Award and one of the top experts in American sign-language research.

The mortality rate for these patients is high and the cardinal feature among them is impaired exercise tolerance. While evidence based drug&#xA0;therapies improve&#xA0;survival in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction, they do not&#xA0;improve survival in HFpEF patients, Haykowsky said.</p><p>&#x201C;We are looking at peripheral non-cardiac factors that affect exercise tolerance and their improvement with exercise training,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;In HFpEF patients, we believe that the muscle sympathetic activity is over active. We will also be measuring HFpEF patients&#x2019; cardiorespiratory fitness, aerobic endurance, functional performance and quality of life.&#x201D;</p><p>Haykowsky will work with several leading heart disease researchers from the college on this study, including Paul Fadel, a professor, neural cardio-vascular control expert and the college&#x2019;s associate dean for research; Michael Nelson, an assistant professor of kinesiology, who is studying a frequently misdiagnosed heart condition in women; and Kathryn Daniel and Daisha Cipher, both associate professors in the college.&#xA0;</p><p>They will study HFpEF patients and healthy controls who are 60 and older. The HFpEF patients will then be randomly assigned to two exercise training groups. One group will meet at UTA for exercise sessions three days a week for 16 weeks. The second group will be a control group. Researchers will strive to improve the muscle sympathetic nerve activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, aerobic endurance and functional performance and quality of life. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;This grant is a huge win for our research faculty, for the college and for the University of Texas at Arlington,&#x201D; said Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation. &#x201C;The study conducted by Professor Haykowsky and his team of seasoned researchers will make a significant contribution to the body of knowledge on heart disease and help us get to the bottom of some heart ailments that continue to elude us.&#x201D;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About the UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation</span></b></p><p>UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/index.php\">College of Nursing and Health Innovation</a> is a National League for Nursing Center of Excellence and encompasses one of the nation&#x2019;s largest and most successful nursing schools and a renowned kinesiology program offering degrees in exercise science, kinesiology, athletic training and an undergraduate track in public health.

Once settled, zebra mussels reach maturity within one year of life. Thus, they can rapidly develop very high densities after invasion disrupting aquatic ecosystems. In addition, they settle in and foul industrial raw water facilities,&#x201D; he added.</p><p>Zebra mussels (<i>Dreissena polymorpha)</i> are small bivalve mollusks. Most are about the size of a human fingernail, but they can grow to a length of nearly 2 inches. They were introduced to North America from Europe via transatlantic shipping, first appearing in the Great Lakes in 1988. From there they made their way to the Mississippi, Hudson, St. Lawrence, Ohio, Missouri, Huron, Colorado, Canadian and Arkansas Rivers, invading the major drainages of the Mississippi and other rivers in all but the far northwestern United States. Major mussel infestations now occur in Texas water bodies on the drainages of the Red, Trinity and Brazos Rivers.</p><p>Zebra mussels attach themselves to rocks and other hard surfaces, or to the shells of other mussels, by byssal threads, which are silky fibers made from proteins. This allows them to form encrustations which can be several shells thick and can lead to densities of 100,000 individuals per meter squared, which are not uncommon in infested waters, McMahon said.</p><p>McMahon is joined on the project by Brian Van Zee, director of Fisheries Management Office, Region 1, Inland Fisheries Division, TP&amp;WD; and by Monica McGarrity, Austin Aquatic Invasive Species team leader, Inland Fisheries Division, Habitat Conservation Branch, TP&amp;WD. The research is a continuation of an ongoing project initiated by McMahon at Lake Texoma in 2011 and continued at Lake Ray Roberts in 2012, Lake Belton in 2014 and recently invaded Lake Lewisville and Eagle Mountain Lake earlier this year.</p><p>The researchers will use monthly samples from infested Texas lakes to estimate mussel spring and fall cohort growth rates and life spans, juvenile settlement rates, periods when mussel planktonic larvae are capable of settlement, impact of water temperature on annual variation in mussel nutritional condition, and chlorophyll a and total phosphate concentrations in the water column as a measure of overall lake productivity.</p><p>&#x201C;Our study has a special emphasis on understanding the causes of the zebra mussel population collapses that have occurred in Texas lakes and other warm, southwestern water bodies,&#x201D; McMahon said.</p><p>In three Texas lakes &#x2013; Texoma, Ray Roberts and Belton &#x2013; a rapid increase in the number of zebra mussels has been followed by a sharp decline. The mussels can starve themselves out by removing plankton, phosphates and nitrates from the water, and flooding may also lead to a decrease in their numbers. Some Texas lakes with low calcium concentrations, particularly in East Texas, are resistant to zebra mussel invasion because mussels require relatively high calcium concentrations in order to thrive. McMahon said constant monitoring of infested lakes is needed, and added it may be years before the full impact of the mussels on lakes&#x2019; water quality and biodiversity is known.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve seen that in some reservoirs, they&#x2019;ll eat themselves out of house and home and the population will crash, but then it reaches a stage where they&#x2019;ll come back and the population will stabilize at some level,&#x201D; Van Zee said. &#x201C;Once they become established in a reservoir, there&#x2019;s not really a way to eradicate them.&#x201D;</p><p>Van Zee met McMahon in 2009 when zebra mussels were first found in Texas and says McMahon&#x2019;s expertise has been highly beneficial as state authorities try to find the best way to handle the mussels&#x2019; invasion of Texas.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. McMahon has been a great asset to the Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department with his knowledge and experience,&#x201D; Van Zee said. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s a phenomenal resource for us in dealing with this problem.&#x201D;</p><p>The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has been making a concerted effort over the last several years to educate recreational boaters about zebra mussels and how not to be vector for their introduction to other uninfested Texas water bodies, McMahon said. The campaign (<a href=\"http://texasinvasives.org/zebramussels\">http://texasinvasives.org/zebramussels</a>) involves educating boaters to &#x201C;Clean, Drain and Dry&#x201D; their watercraft to make sure that they are not moving zebra mussels and their larvae or other invasive aquatic organisms between water bodies.</p><p>&#x201C;It is now the law in Texas that boaters must drain all water from their boats on leaving any water body so they do not carry zebra mussel larvae to any other water body,&#x201D; McMahon said. &#x201C;As boaters and marina operators become better informed about the dangers associated with unintentional overland transport of zebra mussels and other aquatic invasive plants and animals, it is expected that the number of newly infested Texas lakes will decline through time, and eventually new introductions will cease.&#x201D;</p><p>Clay Clark, department chair and professor of biology, said that McMahon&#x2019;s ongoing work in studying zebra mussels serves an important role in keeping the public informed about a serious threat to water quality and aquatic life in Texas lakes, and also demonstrates the University&#x2019;s commitment to Global Environmental Impact, one of the main tenets of the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. McMahon has been studying the biology and control of invasive aquatic invertebrates such as zebra mussels for many years and his wealth of knowledge will serve the Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department very well in this project,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no one better suited to do this research.&#x201D;</p><p>McMahon received his Ph.D. in Zoology from Syracuse University in 1972 and began his career at UTA the same year. He has served as associate dean for the College of Science as well as dean of the University&#x2019;s Honors College. He was named professor emeritus in biology in 2010.

The project is phase II of a TxDOT Innovation Project that began with a $193,000 phase I award in 2015 and will use lab-scale models to test the findings from the first phase. Anand Puppala, a professor in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/ce\">Civil Engineering Department</a> and associate dean of research in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering\">College of Engineering</a>, is co-principal investigator on the project. Postdoctoral fellow Aravind Pedarla and two of Yu&#x2019;s doctoral students will contribute as well.</p><p>The team is working on this research through UTA&#x2019;s Organized Research Center of Excellence on Sustainable and Resilient Civil Infrastructure, which explores and develops research solutions for better design and construction of sustainable and resilient civil infrastructure in a complex, natural, and man-made hazardous environment.</p><p>During the first phase of the project, Yu and Puppala&#x2019;s review of existing research found that most places that use geothermal energy to warm bridge decks install the heating elements internally during construction because it is easier to implement the technology then. TxDOT, however, identified existing bridges as its area of greatest need, so the researchers will focus on creating new technology that will allow them to add geothermal heating to the undersides of bridges and overpasses instead.</p><p>In new bridges, the process works by pumping groundwater through a circulation pipe to bring thermal energy from the ground to the surface. One end of the circulation pipe is embedded into the bridge deck, which warms to the point where ice and snow melt instead of sticking to the surface. Installing a similar system on external surfaces on the underside of existing bridges adds challenges, because the heat-transfer efficiency must be much better so that the heat goes to the bridge deck, not to the air.</p><p>&#x201C;We are looking for an alternative for deicing solution or sand. Those are costly, troublesome to use, and hard on roads and vehicles. We will look at the long-term cost benefits of using geothermal energy to melt icy roads, as well as the initial costs and environmental impact, and I am confident that our proposals will be preferable to current standards,&#x201D; Yu said.</p><p>The new award will allow the team to build scale models in a lab and test them under various environmental conditions, then apply their findings to near-full-scale deck panels and test those under near field conditions outdoors.</p><p>The research is just one example of how UTA contributes to <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/communities.php\">sustainable urban communities</a>, a theme of the university&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/index.php\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Engineering Dean Peter Crouch.</p><p>&#x201C;Our national infrastructure is a continuing concern, and the research that Dr. Yu and Dr. Puppala have undertaken shows great promise for extending the life of our roads and lessening the environmental impact of making those roads safe during winter conditions,&#x201D; Crouch said.</p><p>According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, Texas has more than 52,000 bridges, by far the most in the United States.</p><p align=\"right\"><i>&#x2014; Written by Jeremy Agor</i></p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of about 55,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

Singlet oxygen is a highly reactive type of oxygen that irreversibly damages cell mitochondria and eventually causes cell death.</p><p>&#x201C;Up to now, photodynamic therapy, which depends on visible, ultraviolet or near infrared light, was considered effective for skin cancers or cancers close to the skin surface,&#x201D; Chen said. &#x201C;Our new concept combining microwaves with photodynamic therapy opens up new avenues for targeting deeper tumors and has already proven effective in rapidly and safely reducing tumor size.&#x201D;</p><p>In prior studies, the researchers had identified a new type of nanoparticle, copper-cysteamine or Cu-Cy, that could be activated by X-rays to produce singlet oxygen and slow the growth of tumors. X-ray radiation, however, poses significant risks to patients and can harm healthy tissue.&#xA0;</p><p>In this new lab study, the team demonstrated that the nanoparticle Cu-Cy also can be activated by microwaves, which can be targeted directly at the tumor itself without harming surrounding tissue.</p><p>&#x201C;Our new microwave-induced photodynamic therapy offers numerous advantages, the most significant of which is increased safety,&#x201D; Chen said. &#x201C;Our nanoparticle Cu-Cy also demonstrates very low toxicity, is easy to make and inexpensive, and also emits intense luminescence, which means it can also be used as an imaging agent.&#x201D;</p><p>The researchers demonstrated that both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies on an osteosarcoma cell line showed significant cell destruction using copper cysteamine nanoparticles under microwave activation. The heating effects and the release of copper ions from copper cysteamine upon activation was the main mechanism for the generation of the reactive oxygen needed for cancer cell destruction.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption200\"><img alt src=\"/news/images/wei-chen.jpeg\" width=\"200\"><figcaption>Wei Chen, UTA professor of physics and lead author of the study published this month in&#xA0;The Journal of Biomedical Nanotechnology</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Chen was joined on this research by Lun Ma, a UTA research assistant professor in physics, as well as Mengyu Yao, Lihua Li and Yu Zhang from the Guangdong Key Laboratory of Orthopaedic Technology and Implant Materials in Guangzhou, China, and Junying Zhang from the Physics Department at Beihang University in Beijing, China.

MacDowell Center for Critical Languages and Area Studies.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/vaccaro-figure2.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Kneeling figure seen from behind. verso of figure above, here attributed to Denys Calvaert. c.1607.

The other side had a second drawing of the bottom half of a draped figure with bare feet seen from behind, who kneels toward the left.</p><p>On the front side, Vaccaro first identified a signature and the date, 1618, a date when Carracci was already dead. Using a magnifying glass, she detected the name &#x2018;Dionisio/Calvaert/1618&#x2019;. She also noticed that the style of drawing and the figure of the young girl on the front corresponded strongly with other drawings by Calvaert.&#xA0;</p><p>Even more importantly, the purpose of the sketch on the other side exactly matches the lower half of a St. Francis painting in a signed and dated altarpiece of 1607 at the Bob Jones University Museum and Gallery in Greenville, S.C.</p><p>&#x201C;This work involves observation and attention to small details like the draftsmanship of facial features or other style aspects signaling a particular artist,&#x201D; Vaccaro added. &#x201C;My Calvaert discovery has been accepted by the art world and forms part of a large body of research where I have successfully re-attributed dozens of drawings in collections all over the world, including the Louvre and the British Museum, as well as the Uffizi.&#x201D;</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/vaccaro-figure6.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>St. Francis receiving the Christ child from the Virgin, by Denys Calvaert. 1607.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Vaccaro spent additional time at the Uffizi during her appointment in 2015 as Lila Wallace-Reader&#x2019;s Digest Visiting Professor at Villa I Tatti, the Harvard University Center for Italian Renaissance Studies. The program is viewed as one of the foremost institutions for advanced research in the humanities in the world. Vaccaro held a year-long junior fellowship at the same institution in 1998-99.</p><p>Vaccaro joined UTA in 1994 and is a member of the UTA Academy of Distinguished Scholars. She received the Texas Fund for Curatorial Research grant in 2012 and 2011 for travel abroad when she examined Italian pre-1600 drawings in French regional collections, and has earned prestigious international grants, including a stint as a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Drawings and Prints at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p><p>&#x201C;The skill of close looking employed in this research is important for multiple fields, not only art history,&#x201D; Vaccaro said. &#x201C;Medical schools such as Yale University now even require their medical students to take a course in which they go to museums and look carefully at art to sharpen their observational skills.&#x201D;</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>The University of Texas at Arlington</b></span></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

UTA was one of only 13 programs to receive an A+ for its early reading instruction. The report also gave the University an A for teaching proper classroom management skills.</p><p>&#x201C;One reason UTA elementary education students are so well prepared is their extensive classroom teaching experience,&#x201D; Doughty noted. &#x201C;These students spend nearly 200 hours in local elementary school classrooms prior to their 17 weeks of full-time student teaching. We plan to build upon these impactful practices to include additional early field experiences and service learning.&#x201D;</p><p>State Sen. Kelly Hancock, R-North Richland Hills, said, &#x201C;The importance of a quality education is one thing all Texans can agree on.&#xA0; UTA is doing its share to ensure classrooms are equipped with highly trained teachers which gives young students every possible advantage. I applaud UTA&#x2019;s tireless efforts.&#x201D;</p><p>The College of Education is a top producer of highly effective teachers in the state with an especially large concentration of graduates in North Texas. Eighty-nine percent of the College&#x2019;s graduates are hired in the Dallas/Fort Worth region and their teacher attrition rates are the lowest in the area, according to a 2016 report from the Houston-based Center for Research, Evaluation, and Advancement of Teacher Education. That report also found that more than 82 percent of UTA-prepared teachers remain in the classroom after five years, well above the state average of 72.5 percent.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/college-of-ed-teacher-prep.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>&quot;My goal for the college is that we continue to have a positive impact on the metroplex and beyond through new programs and ongoing collaboration with our PreK-12 partners,&quot; Doughty said. &quot;Our local schools have specifically expressed a need for greater teacher preparation in both bilingual education and special education. Thus, we will offer undergraduate coursework leading to certification in bilingual education/ELL (English Language Learning) and special education this fall and launch a master&apos;s program in special education in January 2018 to address the critical demand for teachers in these areas.&quot;</p><p>Doughty noted that the College is also partnering with two local school districts to open teacher academies. More than 150 high school students per year will enter those programs and will be guaranteed teaching positions in their school districts once they successfully complete their coursework and graduate from UTA.</p><p>In addition to teachers, the College of Education produces a large number of superintendents, principals and administrators through robust on-campus and online degree certification offerings. Valuecolleges.com listed UTA&#x2019;s online Master of Education program No. 2 on its Top 50 Best Value Online Graduate Education Programs. The online graduate programs are also ranked No. 56 nationally and third highest in Texas by&#xA0;<i>U.S. News and World Report.</i></p><p>&#x201C;On the educational continuum, we consider PreK-12 educators, community colleges and adult learning programs to be equally engaged and committed partners on our journey to producing the intellectual capital our state needs for a healthy future,&#x201D; UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said. &#x201C;We provide school districts with a talented pipeline of highly qualified teachers and administrators, and through innovative research, our nationally recognized faculty shape educational policy at all levels. We each play a pivotal role in achieving the state&#x2019;s educational goals for its citizenry.&#x201D;</p><p>As the model 21<sup>st</sup>&#xA0;century urban research university, UTA is working to transform student experiences and ensure success for all.

These molecules are in increasingly high demand for use in a variety of applications, including pharmaceutical and other medical-related activities. They are also widely used in organic chemistry, particularly as protecting groups, reducing agents and synthetic intermediates.</p><p>&#x201C;The goal of our research is to develop novel compounds from readily accessible, simple chemical building blocks,&#x201D; said Junha Jeon, UTA assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry and leader of the project. &#x201C;The synthetic methods developed in this research will provide broadly applicable, time- and cost-saving, synthetic routes to provide rapid access to compounds for subsequent use in drug discovery and development, thus contributing to the promotion of human health.&#x201D;</p><p>The project, titled &#x201C;Catalytic Reductive C-H and C-C Silylation with Silyl Acetals,&#x201D; is funded by a three-year, $424,720 grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, one of the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>Current methods to prepare these organosilanes utilize multi-step procedures which demand considerable time and effort. The project&#x2019;s goal is the design and application of single-pot, transition metal-catalyzed reductive C-H and C-C silylations for the synthesis of a new class of organosilanes.</p><p>A single-pot, or one-pot, synthesis improves the efficiency of a chemical reaction by subjecting a compound to successive chemical reactions using a single reactor. This method is preferred by chemists because it avoids a lengthy separation process and purification of the intermediate chemical compounds which saves time and resources while increasing chemical yield.</p><p>Jeon said the research will deliver several positive outcomes.</p><p>&#x201C;There are three main aims of the research,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;In the first two, we will develop a new, simple, catalytic strategy for breaking an ubiquitous yet inert carbon-hydrogen bond and installing a new highly useful silicon moiety. This will allow for the rapid preparation of bio-medically important drugs.</p><p>&#x201C;The third aim will provide a new tool to selectively break a strong carbon-carbon bond over adjacent, abundant carbon-hydrogen bonds and incorporate a silicon moiety. This method will be highly useful to prepare biologically active, secondary metabolites and pharmaceuticals.&#x201D;</p><p>The project has already yielded one paper, titled&#xA0;<a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b04018\">&#x201C;Catalytic Reductive ortho-C&#x2014;H Silylation of Phenols with Traceless, Versatile Acetal Directing Groups and Synthetic Applications of Dioxasilines&#x201D;</a>, which was published in the&#xA0;<i>Journal of the American Chemical Society</i>&#xA0;in June. Jeon co-authored the paper with Yuanda Hua, a UTA postdoctoral researcher; and two of the graduate students who work in his laboratory, Parham Asgari and Thirupataiah Avullala.</p><p>Jeon explained that during the past three decades, significant advances have been made to the organic processes of selectively transforming ubiquitous yet inert carbon-hydrogen bonds to other useful chemical entities. One reliable strategy for selective carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage within an organic is the use of a transition metal catalyst and a directing group, Jeon said. However, such a directing group is often difficult to install and manipulate after processes are completed.</p><p>&#x201C;In this paper we describe how we first developed a general strategy for transition metal catalyst-assisted, site-selective carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage and insertion of a silicon moiety to phenols with a traceless directing group,&#x201D; Jeon said. &#x201C;We believe that our new carbon-hydrogen bond functionalization approach to exploit readily available phenols and silanes more efficiently and cleanly will ultimately allow the practical production of diverse, biomedically important phenol derivatives and silicon-based materials.&#x201D;</p><p>A traceless directing group means that after a specific group directs, or guides, a catalyst to a specific position of a carbon-hydrogen bond within phenol, the group disappears without a trace. Phenols are a group of organic compounds whose aromatic ring is bonded to an alcohol group. Because phenol contains an alcohol group, it is able to form a very strong hydrogen bond with other molecules and often displays significant biological activities. Silanes are the basic building blocks of silicon chemistry and are versatile materials used in a wide range of applications.</p><p>Fred MacDonnell, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, said that Jeon&#x2019;s research has the potential to provide major positive impact on health and the human condition, one of four main themes in UTA&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Jeon&#x2019;s work is really starting to get a lot of attention from the scientific community and speaks to his creativity in this very challenging research area,&#x201D; MacDonnell said.</p><p>Jeon joined UTA in 2011. He earned a bachelor&#x2019;s of science degree in Chemistry in 2000 and a master&#x2019;s degree in Organic Chemistry in 2002, both from Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea. He then came to the United States and did doctoral work at the University of Minnesota, receiving his Ph.D. in Organic Chemistry in 2009. After a two-year stint as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he came to UTA.&#xA0;</p><p align=\"right\">-&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; By Greg Pederson, contributing writer</p><p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>The University of Texas at Arlington</b></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

A patient simply exhales into the device, which uses semiconductor sensors like those in a household carbon monoxide detector. &#xA0;</p><p>The difference is that these sensors are specific to the gas detected, yet still inexpensive, and can isolate biomarkers associated with the flu virus and indicate whether or not the patient has the flu. The device could eventually be available in drugstores so that people can be diagnosed earlier and take advantage of medicine used to treat the flu in its earliest stages. This device may help prevent flu epidemics from spreading, protecting both individuals as well as the public health.</p><p>Gouma and her team relied on existing medical literature to determine the quantities of known biomarkers present in a person&#x2019;s breath when afflicted with a particular disease, then applied that knowledge to find a combination of sensors for those biomarkers that is accurate for detecting the flu. For instance, people who suffer from asthma have increased nitric oxide concentration in their breath, and acetone is a known biomarker for diabetes and metabolic processes. When combined with a nitric oxide and an ammonia sensor, Gouma found that the breath monitor may detect the flu virus, possibly as well as tests done in a doctor&#x2019;s office.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption200\"><img alt=\"Sensors\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/breath-monitor-prototype-2.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Gouma&apos;s sensors are at the heart of her breath analyzer device.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>&#x201C;I think that technology like this is going to revolutionize personalized diagnostics.

Jay Professor in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation at The University of Texas Arlington, co-authored the article, which was published in&#xA0;<a href=\"https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-016-1577-y\">The Malaria Journal</a>.</p><p>Mauro Marrelli, who was a visiting professor at the college early in 2016, co-wrote the article. Marrelli, an internationally renowned entomologist, parasitologist and molecular biologist, currently is a professor of public health at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil.</p><p>Each year, malaria afflicts more than 500 million people in scores of countries around the world, killing more than 400,000, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p>But Brotto said most studies on fighting malaria focus on the mosquito-borne parasite that causes the illness while ignoring the impact of the disease on skeletal muscles and the heart.</p><p>Moderate or high levels of malaria infection typically affect skeletal muscles and the heart, Brotto said.</p><p>&#x201C;Residual effects could be from the heart being weaker for some time to permanently suffering some damage,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Muscles are also very similar. If you develop chronic myopathy, it becomes harder to get in shape. The parasite takes away the normal ability of the blood cells to carry nutrients and oxygen to the body. That triggers the process of the demise.&#x201D;</p><p>He noted that even those with mild cases of malaria report a lot of muscle soreness and fatigue. He said people who eat healthy diets and exercise will be in a stronger position to vanquish the disease and to do so in a shorter amount of time.</p><p>&#x201C;There are interventions you could take prior to or in anticipation of an infection in order to improve the muscular and heart function,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;People would not feel so tired and so weak if they have a targeted intervention.&#x201D;</p><p>Examples of these interventions include anti-oxidant therapy through diet and medication. The authors recommend eating more uncooked fruits and vegetables and fiber as well as increasing protein intake through the consumption of meat, poultry, fish, legumes and protein shakes or powders, particularly those with some specific combinations of amino acid derivatives such as hydroxyl beta-methylbutyric acid or HMB.</p><p>Exercise is a great tool for combating the infection, too, he said.</p><p>&#x201C;The better shape you&#x2019;re in, the more prepared you will be to fight the infection,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>He said understanding strategies for treating malaria is more important than ever because Americans travel around the world in record numbers. Many visit countries where malaria is prevalent. In addition, more U.S. military personnel are deployed to regions where the disease is rampant, including South America, Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>&#x201C;Diseases increasingly transcend borders. This is a terrific example of how the work we do here at the college crosses borders,&#x201D; said Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation. &#x201C;Marco&#x2019;s work on malaria is a reminder that when we work to improve health and the human condition, we must look at how we can do it globally.&#x201D;</p><p>Improving health and the human condition is one of the four guiding themes of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020</a>: Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</p><p>This study builds on a previous study by Brotto and Marrelli that showed that malaria infection caused muscle degradation.</p><p>&#x201C;Even more specifically, it causes degradation of proteins in the muscles responsible for contraction,&#x201D; Brotto said. &#x201C;We were the first to reveal that. Many other studies have replicated our original research. For this paper, we reviewed all the literature related to malaria and the effects of malaria on muscles and the heart. Our plan is to continue our studies with some new genetic markers we recently obtained together in studies between our labs and submit a joint grant proposal to expand these studies since they also could have applications to muscle diseases.&#x201D;</p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About the UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation</span></b></p><p>UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/index.php\">College of Nursing and Health Innovation</a> is a National League for Nursing Center of Excellence and encompasses one of the nation&#x2019;s largest and most successful nursing schools and a renowned kinesiology program offering degrees in exercise science, kinesiology, athletic training and an undergraduate track in public health.

The results will be disseminated across the CIRTL network and then nationally.&#xA0;</p><p>This new program is one of three grants UTA has recently received to promote doctoral programs focused on STEM fields, with a special emphasis on under-represented minorities and underserved groups.</p><p>UTA&#x2019;s Physics Department received a $563,584 award for the training of Physics Ph.D.s at UTA, again through the Department of Education&#x2019;s Graduate Assistantships in Areas of National Need program.</p><p>&#x201C;We have received two previous GAANN awards, and during that time, the number of Ph.D. students and graduates increased by 50 percent,&#x201D; said Ramon Lopez, physics professor and principal investigator on this new grant. &#x201C;The combination of our strong and growing research program along with student success is the reason we are winning these grants.&#x201D;</p><p>UTA&#x2019;s Mathematics Department also received a $500,000 NSF Award to operate a three-year bridge project involving 30 students to transition them from bachelor&#x2019;s degrees to doctoral programs in the mathematical sciences. This three-year project aims at increasing the quality and quantity of doctoral students in the mathematical sciences through strong mentoring and that fast-track component and attracts students to UT Arlington through the Gulf States Math Alliance in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.</p><p>&#x201C;During the last 10 years, this UTA mathematics program has successfully supported more than 30 students who completed their Ph.D. in Mathematics, including a large proportion of women and under-represented minorities, supported by the Department of Education&#x2019;s Graduate Assistantships in Areas of National Need program,&#x201D; said UTA Mathematics Chair Jianzhong Su, who is the principal investigator on this new NSF bridge project grant.</p><p>&#x201C;We have an award-winning program here at UTA, which makes us competitive for additional grants like this one from the National Science Foundation,&#x201D; he added.</p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

UTA is harnessing its expertise across the sciences, engineering and nursing to solve this global health crisis.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is becoming a major cancer research institution, receiving more than $6 million dollars in new grants in 2016 to strengthen its integrated cancer research program and improve outcomes across the complete spectrum of the patient experience.</p><p class=\"p1\">&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s scientific expertise across basic cancer research, identification and diagnostics and non-invasive, mid-term, invasive and post-operative therapies is accelerating dramatically in order to enable substantial impact on health in Texas,&#x201D; UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said.</p><p class=\"p1\">&#x201C;By assembling a world-class team that works together we hope not only to make transformative advances in key areas related to cancer, but also to provide the highest level of educational and research experiences to our students, in keeping with our Strategic Plan theme of Health and the Human Condition.&#x201D;</p><p>Following a strong recruiting effort, UTA&#x2019;s cancer team now includes more than 25 faculty from across the Colleges of&#xA0; Science, Engineering and Nursing and Health Innovation, all focused on developing new ways to find and treat cancer.</p><p>&#x201C;In 2016, UTA was named in the elite group of R1: Doctoral Universities - Highest Research Activity by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, joining a distinguished group of 115 institutions including Harvard, MIT and Johns Hopkins,&#x201D; added Duane Dimos, UTA&#x2019;s vice president for research. &#x201D;We also broke ground on a new $125 million Science and Engineering Innovation and Research building, which will be the University&#x2019;s signature research facility for multidisciplinary life and health science teaching and research. It is our moment to move forward in cancer.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"p1\">UTA&#x2019;s cancer research is also moving out of the lab and into the commercial sector, with several companies formed around the University in key areas like immunotherapy or the development of novel chemical compounds to attack cancer.</p><p class=\"p1\">&#x201C;We are positioning UTA as the innovation hub around cancer for the North Texas region,&#x201D; Dr. Dimos said.&#xA0;</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption666\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/cancer-timeline.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>UTA is a leader in cancer research</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p><b>Basic cancer research to improve drug design</b></p><p>In 2016, UTA recruited several new biology faculty around cutting-edge fields such as the study of the genetic mutations of cancer cells, how cells respond to mitochondrial stress and the potential role of enzymes that can regulate cell death in cancer.</p><p class=\"p1\">Among the new hires is acclaimed cell biology researcher Mark Pellegrino, who left Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York for UTA to study mitochondrial stress signaling in the context of cancer biology, supported by a large grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas. Dr. Pellegrino&#x2019;s discovery that mitochondria are an important activator of innate immunity was published in the leading journal <i>Nature</i> in 2014.</p><p>&#x201C;When the mitochondria becomes dysfunctional, a pathway is activated in an attempt to repair itself,&#x201D; Pellegrino said. &#x201C;Down the line, I can envision that pathway being manipulated to develop new therapies for cancer.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Identification and diagnotics: treatments designed for each patient.</b></p><p class=\"p1\"><b>Big Data</b></p><p>Precision medicine, or the development of treatments specifically designed for each patient, is one of the fastest-growing areas of cancer research, and requires core strength in both data mining and genomics to improve diagnostics and better predict treatment outcomes.</p><p>The University, which already runs a Human Genomics Center through the Shimadzu Institute for Research Technologies as well as a Genomics Core Facility within its biology department, made several hires in 2016 to strengthen its capacity in computational modeling and the identification of biomarkers for cancer and received new large grants in this strategic focus area.</p><p>Heng Huang, a UTA professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department, won a $1.3 million grant from the National Science Foundation in October 2016 to analyze histopathology images and cancer genomics data to yield a mechanistic understanding from gene to phenotypic markers and cancer outcomes. This comprehensive and integrative study of cancer imaging-omics will facilitate the precision medicine research that has cancer treatment as a near-term focus.</p><p>&#x201C;The long-term plan for this research is to be able to treat an individual based on his or her image-omics data,&#x201D; Dr. Huang said. &#x201C;For instance, if a patient&#x2019;s tissue images change, how is that related to genomics? Or, how can we use multi-omics to detect mutations? Once we find the biomarkers in the data, we can provide precision medicine strategy to treat the illness, from determining life expectancy to tailoring medicines to an individual&#x2019;s needs.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"p1\">In related research, Junzhou Huang, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering, earned an $535,763 National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2016 to investigate a process by which image-omics data can be combined into files that are small enough that current computing technology will allow scientists to better predict how long a patient will live and how best to treat that patient.</p><p>&#x201C;We are pulling together a team that will be able to harness the power of computational modelling alongside real clinical diagnostics, to develop new screening and diagnostics tools and to better monitor treatment and individual patient outcomes,&#x201D; Dimos said.</p><p><b>Screening and Diagnostics</b></p><p>UTA has built up significant expertise in the screening and diagnostics of cancer in clinical settings, including the development of specific biomedical devices that improve early detection of the disease and predictive capacities around cancer metasisis. &#xA0;</p><p>Zui Pan, an esophageal cancer biomarker researcher, joined UTA&#x2019;s nursing faculty in 2016 from The Ohio State University College of Medicine. Her work has been funded by a $1.6 million grant from the National Institutes of Health &#x2013; National Cancer Institute and helps develop new screening methods for early detection and prognosis in addition to novel therapeutic drugs for this deadly disease.</p><p>&#x201C;My team has identified a protein named Orai1 that is strongly associated with esophageal tumor progression,&#x201D; Dr. Pan said. &#x201C;We plan to evaluate the protein as a potential biomarker for esophageal cancer detection and prognosis with a goal of developing more effective therapeutic interventions for patients suffering from the disease.&#x201D;</p><p><b>Non-invasive therapies: important contributions from science and engineering</b></p><p><b>Imaging and Simulation</b></p><p>UTA has focused important efforts in 2016 on strengthening niche areas such as imaging and simulation where its expertise in science and engineering can make a real contribution improving the effectiveness of non-invasive cancer therapies.</p><p>One key success was Baohong Yuan&#x2019;s second large grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas to optimize deep-tissue imaging technology that could allow better monitoring of tumor growth.</p><p>The bioengineering associate professor&#x2019;s original grant focused on the growth of blood vessels in tumors. To grow, a tumor must generate blood vessels for oxygen and nutrients. Dr. Yuan successfully created imaging technology that gave clear images of those blood vessels, which tend to be disorganized.</p><p>With this technology in place, Yuan will now focus on differentiation of cells at the molecular level, including identifying specific biomarkers that may be linked to blood vessel growth.</p><p>&#x201C;There are many signal pathways that can lead to blood vessel growth,&#x201D; Yuan said. &#x201C;Researchers have successfully stopped single pathways, but that has not proved successful in the long term. If we can simultaneously stop multiple pathways, it could significantly stop or slow growth and allow more time for treatment, but to do this we must be able to monitor the molecular receptors.&#x201D;</p><p>UTA physicists, led by Mingwu Jin, began working with UT Southwestern and MD Anderson Cancer Center this year on multiple projects sponsored by the National Institutes of Health to develop devices and algorithms to improve the delivery of cancer therapies to patients.</p><p>In one project, the team is working to improve the quality of image-guided radiotherapy techniques that allow for better visualization of tumors, enabling physicians to deliver radiation doses to patients with high precision. In another project, UTA researchers are developing a device that can integrate tumor imaging and photo-induced cancer therapy in a single, portable device. A third project focuses on developing a novel real-time dose-monitoring method for heavy ion therapies.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Jin&#x2019;s work will employ big data analysis and physics models to improve technologies used to deliver cancer therapy and ultimately improve patient care,&#x201D; said UTA Physics Chair Alex Weiss. &#x201C;These collaborations with UT Southwestern and MD Anderson demonstrate clearly the leading role that a scientific research institution like UTA can play to advance knowledge needed by medical institutions.&#x201D;</p><p>Yuze &#x201C;Alice&#x201D; Sun, an assistant professor of electrical engineering, also earned a $500,000 National Science Foundation CAREER award in 2016 to develop optofluidic lasers to detect biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and other genetic disorders at the molecular and cellular levels.</p><p>Most lasers are semiconductor-based and require solid material to create cavities to confine light. In optofluidic lasers, two-phase liquids are controlled using microfluidics and nanofluidics to form a highly efficient optical microcavity. The all-liquid nature makes the laser adaptive and achieves high-precision tuning in an unprecedented manner, and is uniquely positioned as a novel biosensing technology.</p><p>Dr. Sun said she initially will explore using the optofluidic laser to detect biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and possibly other genetic disorders at the molecular and cellular levels.</p><p>&#x201C;This could someday lead to the creation of a point-of-care platform for clinicians to use in an office, rather than having to send samples away for analysis,&#x201D; Sun said.</p><p><b>&#xA0;</b></p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/cancer-particles.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Nanoparticles activated by microwaves to kill cancer</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p><b>Therapeutic Nanoparticles</b></p><p>UTA is also gaining recognition for developing new treatment techniques using therapeutic nanoparticles and nanoseeds to target cancer cells. Nanoparticles and nanoseeds have advantages over traditional therapies, as they can directly target cancer tumors without affecting healthy surrounding tissues.</p><p>One recent success is the work of UTA physicist Wei Chen, who gained international attention in 2016 for research showing that using microwaves to activate photosensitive nanoparticles produces tissue-heating effects and reactive oxygen species that ultimately lead to cell death within solid tumors.</p><p>In prior studies, the researchers had identified a new type of photosensitive nanoparticle, copper-cysteamine or Cu-Cy.&#xA0; They have now demonstrated that the nanoparticle Cu-Cy can also be activated by microwaves, which can be targeted directly at the tumor itself without harming surrounding tissue.</p><p>&#x201C;Our new microwave-induced photodynamic therapy offers numerous advantages, the most significant of which is increased safety,&#x201D; Dr. Chen said. &#x201C;Our nanoparticle Cu-Cy also demonstrates very low toxicity, is easy to make and inexpensive, and also emits intense luminescence, which means it can also be used as an imaging agent.&#x201D;</p><p><b>Mid-term therapies: developing and commercializing new drugs</b></p><p class=\"p1\">UTA researchers are researching and successfully commercializing next-generation cancer therapies, as well as working to improve the performance of drugs that are already in the market and used on a regular basis by cancer patients.</p><p class=\"p1\">The University recently recruited serial entrepreneur Jon Weidanz as associate vice president for research and professor of biology. His research has focused on immuno-oncology, the emerging field of therapies and treatments aimed at harnessing a patient&#x2019;s immune system to combat cancer.&#xA0; His company AbeXXa Biologics, which recently won an award at an Innovation Day at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is developing next-generation antibody drugs that can target specific proteins on cancer cells. AbeXXa has also signed a significant collaboration agreement with a large pharma company to develop next generation therapeutic agents for cancer immunotherapy.</p><p>Another faculty member developing specific drugs around cancer is UTA chemistry and biochemistry Chair Frederick MacDonnell. He is a co-founder of &#xA0;Tuevol Therapeutics, a company which has exclusively licensed the intellectual property to TS101, a ruthenium-based metallodrug that shows effectiveness against platinum-resistant lung cancer.</p><p>Ruthenium is a rare metallic element and the drugs developed at UTA have many of the therapeutic effects of platinum-based drugs, but without the dehabilitating side effects. Rolf Brekken and Tom Wilkie of the UT Southwestern Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncoclogy are co-founders and are working Dr. MacDonnell to advance this drug to clinical studies.</p><p>&#x201C;Further facilitating the translation of our inventions into viable therapies, with investment backing from major pharmaceutical companies, corporate venture capital and angel investors, is an important strategy as we move forward,&#x201D; Dr. Weidanz said. &#x201C;This will allow us to create an innovation hub around cancer that will integrate the University with surrounding businesses and enhance our national and international reputation.&#x201D;</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-5\" src=\"/news/images/cancer-trap.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Cancer trap</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p><b>Invasive Therapies: bioengineering devices</b></p><p>In solutions for invasive cancer therapies, Liping Tang&#x2019;s recent work has led to the creation of a cancer trap, a potentially groundbreaking technology for treating metastatic cancer.</p><p>The cancer trap can be implanted under the skin to attract circulating cancer cells by releasing cancer cell-attracting biomolecules.</p><p>&#x201C;This research tries to stop the cancer before it spreads,&#x201D; Dr. Tang said. &#x201C;We attract the cancer with these decoys, which are artificial lymph nodes made of biodegradable polymers.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Then, when it&#x2019;s trapped, we can use a more targeted radiation.&#x201D;</p><p>Cancer traps also can be incorporated with chemotherapy drugs or immunotherapy agents to locally eliminate cancer cells with minimal systemic toxicity and have the potential to revolutionize treatment of this disease. His work is currently supported by two three-year grants from the Department of Defense and the Wilson Charitable Foundation Trust.</p><p><b>Post-Operative Treatment: Improving Survival Rates</b></p><p class=\"p1\">UTA is also leading the way in developing therapies to improve the quality of life of cancer patients, both during and after treatment. &#xA0;Over the past two years, the University has made cluster hires in the Department of Kinesiology, bringing to the University a group of experts who can bring their innovative vision to improving the patient experience.&#xA0;</p><p class=\"p1\">Mark Haykowsky, a professor in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation and Moritz Chair of Geriatric Nursing and Research at UTA, was recently recruited from Alberta&#x2019;s Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, one of the world&#x2019;s preeminent rehabilitation medicine programs.</p><p class=\"p1\">One of his main areas of research is in cardio-oncology, with specific emphasis on the role that exercise training can play to prevent anti-cancer therapy-mediated cardiovascular dysfunction.</p><p class=\"p1\">This year he launched UTA&#x2019;s FitSteps exercise program, which helps cancer patients increase mobility and boost endurance while undergoing treatment. The program, a partnership with the Cancer Foundation for Life, is structured and tailored to each individual.</p><p>&#x201C;A community&#x2019;s greatest asset is a healthy, thriving population,&#x201D; said UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation Dean Anne Bavier. &#x201C;Partnerships of this kind help ensure better survival rates for cancer patients in our community. They also help ensure a better quality of life. Helping tackle such real life problems is a critically important part of our reason for being as a health-focused college and as a university.&#x201D;</p><p>UTA will continue this strong commitment to cancer and to the Texan community going forward, added UTA President Vistasp Karbhari.</p><p>&#x201C;The National Cancer Institute reports that approximately 39 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;Progress is being made against the disease, but much work remains.

They already knew the target group &#x2013; the students. They go to classes with them,&#x201D; Janakiraman said. &#x201C;The ultimate question was how does the church become appealing to the possible new members without alienating existing members.&#x201D;</p><p>Janakiraman said three teams in the undergraduate class and three teams in the graduate class started by talking extensively to five to 10 people at St. Alban&#x2019;s in the qualitative phase of the survey using a technique called laddering, that does a deep dive into consumer drives and motives. He said the student teams then presented a mid-term report to determine how prevalent the issues brought up by the smaller group were.</p><p>The studies then expanded to more than 200 people in the second half of the semester in an attitude study that included a concept test and a brand positioning assessment test, which is the quantitative phase of the studies.</p><p>&#x201C;It really digs down and surveys many, many more people,&#x201D; Janakiraman said. &#x201C;What comes from both the qualitative and quantitative studies is a brand strategy for the church.&#x201D;</p><p>Janakiraman said if there was one prevalent strategy theme that emerged among the UTA teams studying St. Alban&#x2019;s, it was that more and deeper community outreach was needed. He also cited other options for the church to grow, including becoming more visible and more available to the UTA community.</p><p>And according to many of St. Alban&#x2019;s members, the exercise was fruitful, and confirmed a few of the issues they knew and others that were new and insightful.</p><p>Noni Ahlfinger, St. Alban&#x2019;s communications chair, said the UTA marketing class study of the church will drive future marketing plans.</p><p>Steve Altman, who is on the St. Alban&#x2019;s newcomers committee, said, &#x201C;We understand this is a first and view this study of millennials by millennials to be expert data in our quest to interest more of this age group in our services. St. Alban&#x2019;s and UTA share a property line yet only a few students are aware of the church.&#x201D;</p><p>Ahlfinger said that church membership and leadership expect to shape how St. Alban&#x2019;s reached out to millennials.</p><p>Laine Perry, St. Alban&#x2019;s infrastructure committee chair, said, &#x201C;It will help St. Alban&#x2019;s understand what millennials think of us and how we can be more visible to them. The semester experience of being probed by students has been warm and positive, even professional with students handling some difficult subjects respectfully. Clearly the study has fostered a measure of pride in our neighbors. Already discussions are brewing of additional UTA-St. Alban&#x2019;s cooperative programs.&#x201D;</p><p>Janakiraman said the exercise is a wonderful endeavor for classes in that it gives students something tangible to take to future employers.</p><p>In the past, Janakiraman&#x2019;s classes have worked on marketing plans for a software company, a food company and an after-school program. Next semester, his classes will take on another neighbor, Bombay Chopstix, a restaurant in the College Park District.</p><p>Chandra Subramaniam, interim dean of the College of Business, said Janakiraman&#x2019;s classes are providing intricate, valuable and practical marketing knowledge that his students can use in the real business world.</p><p>&#x201C;In Janakiraman&#x2019;s classes&#x2019; case, it helps our neighboring entities, which helps the UTA community,&#x201D; Subramaniam said. &#x201C;It speaks to building <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/communities.php\">sustainable urban communities</a>, one of the tenets of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan.&#x201D;</p><p>Local businesses interested in examining their product and/or brand strategy would benefit from having Professor Janakiraman&#x2019;s classes address them as projects in their class.

I think every aerospace engineer starts out with a dream to work at NASA someday, and this internship gets me one step closer to realizing that dream,&#x201D; Ground said.</p><p>Ground began working with Associate Professor Luca Maddalena at UTA&#x2019;s Aerodynamics Research Center as a sophomore through the Arlington Undergraduate Research-based Achievement for STEM program. As he became more involved in the research, he decided to enter the B.S. to Ph.D. program.</p><p>&#x201C;Cody joined my research group when he was a sophomore and since day one has been one of our most productive, creative and committed students. He has been an example of dedication and professionalism and I am extremely proud, being his mentor, that his hard work has been rewarded,&#x201D; Maddalena said. &#x201C;I have no doubt he will have a successful and wonderful tenure at NASA. It is extremely gratifying seeing our students jumping from UTA to their dream jobs.&#x201D;</p><p>A ramjet uses its own supersonic speed to compress incoming air in its engine before combustion, but the air flow slows to subsonic speeds as it enters the engine. A scramjet &#x2013; supersonic combusting ramjet &#x2013; maintains a supersonic airflow in the engine, which allows the vehicle to reach and maintain speeds in excess of Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound, which is 768 mph. The challenge is finding a way for air and fuel to mix and achieve combustion with such fast airflow, which Ground likens to trying to light a match &#x2013; and keep it lit &#x2013; during a hurricane.</p><p>The Aerodynamics Research Center has existed at the university in one form or another since the 1930s when it was originally an aircraft maintenance and fabrication facility. The present facility was built in 1986, allowing a large expansion of equipment which now includes low-speed, transonic, supersonic, arc jet and hypersonic tunnels. Current research has focused on experimental high-speed and high-temperature aerodynamics, shock/boundary layer interaction, and detonation.

In their coursework, faculty and students are calling the structures micro houses.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve always wanted to do this kind of project with the students,&#x201D; said Brad McCorkle, a UTA architecture lecturer for the last two years and an alumnus. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the first time UTA has done something like this. We hope to sell these two units once they&#x2019;re completed and fund future projects for Parallel Construction.&#x201D;</p><p>Parallel Construction is the name of CAPPA&#x2019;s design/build program, now in its fourth semester, offering students the opportunity to literally get their hands dirty, as they design and build projects.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Tiny houses\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/cappa-tiny-house-3.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Two tiny houses are being constructed by CAPPA students.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>McCorkle said the tiny houses have received some interest from non-profit organizations and private individuals who have odd-sized residential lots where structures like these make sense.</p><p>Tiny houses are the rage, due in some part to cable television shows that have promoted the trend. HGTV has Tiny House Builders, Tiny House Hunters and Tiny House, Big Living. FYI, the cable network, started Tiny House Nation and Tiny House World. Other networks have run several specials on the phenomena.</p><p>What the students like about the project is that it translates to real-world experience.</p><p>As seniors, architecture students have several options for their senior year: a traditional design studio, a research studio or the design/build studio.</p><p>&#x201C;We have to take this project and have a design, construction documents, a budget and then build it,&#x201D; said Omar Soto, a project manager on one of the tiny houses.</p><p>Cosette Meyer, a co-project manager with Soto, said being involved through each phase of project from design to construction is vital experience for the professional world.</p><p>&#xA0;&#x201C;There are real-world implications with each decision we make,&#x201D; Meyer said. &#x201C;Deciding on certain hardware has an impact on the bottom line.

You have to answer questions like: &#x2018;Where do you make sacrifices?&#x2019; &#x2018;Is your design for the sake of cost?&#x2019; and &#x2018;What impact will locating an electrical outlet here have?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>CAPPA Dean Nan Ellin said the design/build studio has been popular.

The units also have metal skins that reflect a large amount of radiant heat. Those metal roofs allow for the addition of rainwater harvesting and solar energy, he said.</p><p>McCorkle said the units are mobile, too.</p><p>&#x201C;You can take off the roofs and transport them,&#x201D; McCorkle said. &#x201C;In fact, we&#x2019;re seeing if we can afford to get them to the Earth Day event at Fair Park in April. Even if we can&#x2019;t move them there, we will have some sort of presence at the event.&#x201D;</p><p>While CAPPA is still looking for sponsors or donors to help move one of the units for Earth Day or purchase the tiny houses, vendors have already contributed a lot for the projects.</p><p>Audrey Poole, senior specifications project manager for Architectural Lighting Alliance or ALA, was giving presentations to the student teams last week on lighting options in the tiny houses.</p><p>&#x201C;I sure wish a program like this was around when I was a student here,&#x201D; said Poole, who has her&#xA0;undergrad and master&#x2019;s degrees from UTA.</p><p>Besides ALA, other vendors donating time or materials include: Milgard Windows and Doors, Daikin, Huber Engineered Woods, Tom&apos;s Mechanical Inc., ABC Imaging, Delta Millworks and Topping Out.</p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington </span></b></p><div><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

The dual credit courses are from UTA&#x2019;s core curriculum as well as from the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/coed/\">College of Education</a>.</p><p>Once program participants complete their high school curriculum and seamlessly transition to UTA, they will continue coursework with a focus on bilingual and ESL education and have a paid teacher aide position within Grand Prairie ISD. After obtaining their college degree and receiving their teacher certification, Grand Prairie ISD will offer them a pending contract to become a full time educator.</p><p>&#x201C;The best and brightest should be in our classrooms,&#x201D; said Teresa Doughty, Dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Education. &#x201C;This program is built to attract energetic and talented students to the teaching profession. They will be workforce ready when they graduate, and they will go on to make an immediate and lasting impact as highly effective teachers in Grand Prairie schools.&#x201D;</p><p>The Education &amp; Leadership Preparatory Program will accept 100 students per year at the outset.</p><p>Students at Grand Prairie High School, South Grand Prairie High School, and Young Women&#x2019;s Leadership Academy are eligible to participate.

Rodney Anderson, R &#x2013; Grand Prairie.&#xA0; &#x201C;UTA and Grand Prairie ISD have found a way to create a seamless path from a high school degree to a college degree to a meaningful career in one of society&#x2019;s most important professions. There is a shortage of quality teachers in Texas and this is a smart way to address that critical issue.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>UTA&#x2019;s College of Education elementary teacher preparation program recently ranked 24<sup>th</sup> nationally, placing it in the nation&#x2019;s top 3 percent of programs, according to the National Center for Teacher Quality.&#xA0;</p><p>According to a 2016 report from the Houston-based Center for Research, Evaluation, and Advancement of Teacher Education, attrition rates of UTA graduates are the lowest among North Texas teachers. That report found that more than 82 percent of UTA-prepared teachers remain in the classroom after five years, above the state average of 72.5 percent.</p><p>Grand Prairie ISD Superintendent of Schools Susan Simpson Hull said, &#x201C;We are grateful to have a strong partner in UTA. The impact of a great teacher in the classroom is powerful. This program allows us to build leaders who will guide and mold the next generation of scholars in Grand Prairie ISD.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said, &#x201C;Our talented and dedicated faculty are focused on not only providing a high quality education to our students, but also ensuring that we proactively address the critical needs of our community. This program innovatively brings together the expertise of two highly ranked institutions, Grand Prairie ISD and UTA, to help meet a critical need for highly skilled teachers. I am pleased that UTA continues to forge new paths in being of service to the community.&#x201D;</p><p>In addition to addressing a critical workforce need and creating a seamless path, the program also has the potential to lower the cost to degree, as students will follow a prescribed sequence of classes that reduces, even eliminates, the prospect of excess or unusable course credit hours. It also presents a clear path to a job with full time benefits upon graduation. As the model 21<sup>st</sup> century urban research university, UTA is committed to providing a high quality education at an affordable cost while transforming the student experience.

UTA&#x2019;s Department of Civil Engineering is administering both degree plans.</p><p>Ali Abolmaali, chair of the Department of Civil Engineering, said that the degree plan meets students where they want to be taught, which is not always in a conventional classroom. The majority of the courses are offered online.</p><p>&#x201C;You have to be nimble in reaching students on their terms,&#x201D; Abolmaali said. &#x201C;I expect some of our students will be working professionals already in the field but looking to gain that edge in an industry that is demanding many things of managers. We will provide those tools that will enable our construction management graduates to advance up the ladder.&#x201D;</p><p>The degree in construction management is unique in that it equips students with a mastery of the latest in sustainable building techniques along with traditional skills such as accurately detailing project scope, budget, construction schedules, and ability to satisfy quality, safety and environmental expectations.</p><p>Texas has the nation&#x2019;s highest employment rate in construction management with nearly 30,000 construction managers working in Texas, with an annual mean salary of $87,400, according to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Acosta was appointed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott in 2016 to serve as a member of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. &#x201C;UTA is a leader in innovative programs and is doing exactly what we are doing hopeful of our public universities - looking beyond today&#x2019;s horizon and preparing to fill tomorrow&#x2019;s labor needs with advanced skill sets that compliment industry needs and contribute to a healthy economy.&#x201D;</p><p>Graduates of the new degree program will be prepared to apply principles of construction, planning, scheduling and job costing to buildings and other structures.</p><p>&#x201C;All indicators are that North Texas is enthusiastically anticipating this new offering from UTA&#x2019;s Department of Civil Engineering, and now that this is a reality, the program will significantly enhance the scale and intensity of the interaction that the College enjoys with the construction industry&#x201D; said Peter Crouch, dean of the UTA College of Engineering.</p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About the Department of Civil Engineering </span></b></p><p>UTA&#x2019;s Department of Civil Engineering ranks No. 87 in <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x2019;s</i> Best Graduate Schools rankings.

Both types of patients have high mortality rates.</p><p>Typically, measuring leg blood flow and oxygen extraction and consumption is a tedious process.

Examples include thermostats for home heating and cooling and automatic transmission systems in vehicles.</p><p>In addition to fuzzy logic, Liang is an expert in radar and wireless sensor networks, wireless communications, compressive sensing, smart grids and signal processing for communications.</p><p>Liang joined UTA as an assistant professor in 2002. He was promoted to associate professor in 2008 and became a full professor in 2011. He received an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award in 2003 to develop a fuzzy logic system for wireless sensor networks and has earned grants totaling $6 million in his career.</p><p>&#x201C;It is a great honor to be elevated to Fellow status. It recognizes my body of work and my contributions to the field. I hope more colleagues from UTA will join this group in the near future,&#x201D; Liang said.</p><p>Liang has made great contributions to knowledge and use of fuzzy logic systems. He established the theoretical foundation of Interval Type-2 systems, which use simpler mathematics and allow uncertainties to be quantified, and he widely expanded the use of fuzzy controllers in signal processing and digital communication applications. His work has led to applications in military product development and knowledge processing and threat assessment within sensor networks. &#xA0;</p><p>Liang has published more than 280 journal and conference papers and seven book chapters, and has several patents pending. His work is an example of UTA&#x2019;s focus on <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a> as part of the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Being named an IEEE Fellow is a great honor, and Dr. Liang is a truly deserving recipient. His research into fuzzy logic systems has been recognized by his peers worldwide as groundbreaking and this new status bestowed upon Dr. Liang is clear recognition of this,&#x201D; said Peter E. Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering and an IEEE Fellow. &#x201C;It is the hard work, dedication and peer recognition of faculty like Dr. Liang that helps the College of Engineering grow in stature and meet the goals of the College and the University.&#x201D;</p><p>Liang is the 11th current College of Engineering professor to be honored as an IEEE Fellow. Zeynep &#xC7;elik-Butler, Crouch, George Kondraske, Wei-Jen Lee, Frank Lewis, Robert Magnusson and K.R. Rao (electrical engineering), Ishfaq Ahmad, Bill Carroll and Hong Jiang (computer science and engineering), and Khosrow Behbehani (bioengineering) also are IEEE fellows. Purnendu &#x201C;Sandy&#x201D; Dasgupta, UTA&#x2019;s Jenkins Garrett Professor of Chemistry, also was named a IEEE Fellow.</p><p>IEEE is the world&#x2019;s largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. It has more than 421,000 members in more than 160 countries and is a leading developer of international standards that are the basis of many telecommunications, information technology, and power-generation products and services. IEEE and its members inspire a global community through its highly cited publications, conferences, technology standards, and professional and educational activities.</p><p>Fewer than one-tenth of 1 percent of IEEE members worldwide are selected as Fellows in any year.

In addition, the more accurate precipitation information affects everyday people.</p><p>Under the grant, UTA will receive $188,442 and OU will receive $197,546. That $385,988 is part of $6 million in total funding from the NOAA&#x2019;s National Weather Service as part of its Joint Technology Transfer Initiative. The total funding was dispersed to more than 100 academic institutions. The initiative&#x2019;s aim is to get new tools and technologies more rapidly into the hands of weather forecasters.</p><p>&#x201C;NOAA has sharpened its focus on speeding up this important transition of technology to National Weather Service day-to-day operations,&#x201D; said John Cortinas, director of NOAA Research&#x2019;s Office of Weather and Air Quality, which manages the Joint Technology Transfer Initiative in close coordination with NWS, in a news release. &#x201C;This funding represents another important step to get new tools and technologies more rapidly into the hands of our weather forecasters who serve communities around the nation.&#x201D;</p><p>Seo said the project will take into account the weather radar networks, tens of thousands of rain gauges and satellite sensors that the National Weather Service employs.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ll be using that information, running it through a new suite of algorithms to determine heavy-to-extreme precipitation amounts more accurately,&#x201D; Seo said. &#x201C;Our goal is to improve the accuracy by 10 to 20 percent. Being able to estimate precipitation better has a chain reaction of sorts on the entire water prediction and management enterprise. If we&#x2019;re more accurate in precipitation, then we can be more accurate in our streams, creeks and rivers. That leads to being more accurate in flood warnings and in the operation and management of our reservoirs.&#x201D;</p><p>Greg Waller, service coordination hydrologist for the National Weather Service&#x2019;s West Gulf River Forecast Center, said Seo&#x2019;s work will enhance the agency&#x2019;s ability to better serve the public.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Seo is a great teammate,&#x201D; Waller said. &#x201C;His work will help us forecast flooding more accurately. That helps meteorologists and invariably helps the public. We are looking forward to another collaborative effort with UTA.&#x201D;</p><p>College of Engineering Dean Peter Crouch said the research Seo and his team are carrying out in this project is another example of UTA-led research that cuts across data-driven discovery, sustainable urban communities and global environmental impact, three tenants under UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Creating a better tool in determining precipitation amounts is especially beneficial in severe weather episodes,&#x201D; Crouch said. &#x201C;Improving forecasts could save lives and property.&#x201D;</p><p>Seo joined the University in 2010 following professional appointments to the National Weather Service&#x2019;s Hydrologic Research Laboratory in Maryland and as a senior researcher in the Environmental Remote Sensing Research Laboratory at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology in Taejon, Korea.</p><p>Seo earned his master&#x2019;s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his doctoral degree from Utah State University.</p><p>In the spring of 2016, he launched a new Android cell phone app called&#xA0;<i>iSeeFlood</i>&#xA0;to encourage the public to file timely reports when they see flooding of varying severity on the streets, in and around their houses, and in streams and creeks.</p><p>At that same time, Seo&#x2019;s team also installed innovative wireless sensors to improve high-resolution modeling of urban water systems. Researchers about a dozen of the high-tech sensors in Fort Worth, Grand Prairie, Dallas, Arlington and Kennedale.</p><p>Seo was awarded in 2014 a four-year, $1.2 million National Science Foundation grant to improve sustainability of large urban areas from extreme weather, urbanization and climate change.</p><p>That project built on Seo&#x2019;s previous work to help establish the Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere, or CASA, radar system in North Texas. UT Arlington installed the first radar station in North Texas atop of Carlyle Hall in 2012 as part of Seo&#x2019;s research. The CASA system provides weather data every minute compared to every five to six minutes with previous weather radar systems. CASA can adapt to focus on smaller areas, giving the users more detailed information to better monitor and track storms and precipitation.</p><p>Seo was also awarded a two-year $283,000 grant in 2015 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Program Office to forecast inflows into water supply reservoirs and to generate optimal solutions for operation of water supply systems for major water providers in the region.

The unconventional results are consistent with Newton&#x2019;s Second Law of Motion, a well-established law of physics, and imply that mass should be included in the dynamic model of these nano-systems. The most widely accepted models omit mass at that scale.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Alan Bowling\" src=\"/news/images/alan-bowling.jpeg\" width=\"300\"><figcaption>Alan Bowling, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Alan Bowling, an assistant professor of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/mae/\" title=\"http://www.uta.edu/mae/\">mechanical and aerospace engineering</a>,collaborated with Samarendra Mohanty, an assistant physics professor, anddoctoral students Mahdi Haghshenas-Jaryani, Bryan Black and Sarvenaz Ghaffari,as well as graduate student James Drake to make the discovery.</p><p>A key advantage of the new model is that it can be used to buildcomputer simulations of &#xA0;nano-sized objects that have drastically reducedrun times as compared to a conventional model based on Newton&#x2019;s second law.These conventional models have run times of days, weeks, months and years whilethe new model requires only seconds or minutes to run.</p><p>In the past, researchers attempted to address the long run time byomitting the mass terms in the model. This resulted in faster run times but,paradoxically, violated Newton&#x2019;s second law upon which the conventional modelwas based. The remedy for this paradox was to argue that mass was unimportantat the nano-scale.</p><p>However, the new model retains mass, and predicts unexpectedmotion of nano-sized objects in a fluid that has been experimentally observed.The new model also runs much faster than both the conventional and masslessmodels.</p><p>It is expected that this new model will significantly accelerateresearch involving small-scale phenomena.</p><p>Research areas that Bowling and collaborators at UT Arlington arecurrently investigating include cell migration, protein function, bionicmedical devices and nanoparticle suspensions for storing thermal energy.However, the applications for the computer simulation in medicine, biology, andother fields are endless.</p><p>The research is detailed in the paper&#xA0;<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11071-013-1185-0\">&#x201C;Dynamicsof Microscopic Objects in Optical Tweezers: Experimental Determination ofUnderdamped Regime and Numerical Simulation using Multiscale Analysis&#x201D;</a>&#xA0;andpublished online by the&#xA0;<i>Journal of Non-Linear Dynamics.&#xA0;</i>Thepaper is scheduled for publication in the journal&#x2019;s print version later thisyear.</p><p>Khosrow Behbehani, dean of the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/\" title=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/index.php\">College of Engineering</a>,said the team&#x2019;s findings may alter ways of thinking throughout the engineeringand scientific worlds.</p><p>&#x201C;The paper is only the beginning for this research,&#x201D; Behbehanisaid. &#x201C;I anticipate a high level of interest in the findings. It couldtransform the way we conduct research in nano-engineering by providingresearchers with the ability to study such physical phenomena at such smallscale through the model.&#x201D;</p><p>The team used optical tweezers previously developed by Mohanty tomeasure oscillations that occur at the nano scale, thus proving that mass andacceleration must be considered at that level as well.</p><p>&#x201C;We proved it in the lab,&#x201D; Bowling said. &#x201C;Publication in anaccepted journal is the next step in gaining mass acceptance of the idea, whichflies in the face of what most people believe now.&#x201D;</p><p>The discovery resulted from a 2012 National Science Foundation&#xA0;<a href=\"../../2012/06/bowling-nsf-eager.php\">grantproject</a>&#xA0;in which the UT Arlington team investigated a new model forhow motor proteins behave in the body.

Garland School of Social Work at Baylor University; Donna Aguiniga, associate professor at the University of Alaska-Anchorage School of Social Work; and UTA doctoral candidate Marcus Crawford.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to understand the decision-making experiences of women who have relinquished their parental rights to adoption within the past 25 years, as well as the context in which options surrounding crisis pregnancies are discussed with expectant parents by professionals in the adoption community. The current report represents Phase I of the study and includes findings from an online survey of 223 first/birth parents and an online survey of 141 adoption professionals.</p><p>Key Findings</p><ul><li>More than two-thirds of first/birth mothers reported that they seriously considered other options besides adoption, most commonly to parent their child.</li><li>The majority of first/birth mothers who participated in this study also reported limited to no access to information about parenting.</li><li>The lack of emotional and social support that first/birth mothers felt they needed to successfully parent was one of the deciding factors in their decision to relinquish their parental rights to adoption.</li><li>Approximately four of every five first/birth mothers in this study cited financial concerns as one of the reasons they chose to relinquish their parental rights to adoption.</li></ul><p>&#x201C;For far too long, the experiences of first/birth parents have not been fully understood or taken into consideration as an important part of adoption,&#x201D; said April Dinwoodie, chief executive of The Donaldson Adoption Institute. &#x201C;This large-scale study represents a deep and detailed look at these experiences and will serve to inform future policies and practices.&#x201D;</p><p>She added: &#x201C;We gave a great deal of thought to launching in November with National Adoption Month and ultimately decided that it was time to share this groundbreaking work as all too often the voices and experiences of first/birth parents are completely left out.&#x201D;</p><p>Dean Ryan underlined the importance of the research in the context of UTA&#x2019;s commitment to health and the human condition within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\" target=\"_blank\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</a></p><p>&#x201C;Our research findings will help providers and counselors with establishing and sharing best practices with first/birth parents during the adoption decision-making process,&#x201D; Ryan said. &#x201C;Partnering with The Donaldson Adoption Institute is part of UTA&#x2019;s commitment to finding ways to improve the health and human condition while supporting community organizations that are making an impact.&#x201D;</p><p>Among the recommendations in the 102-page report are:</p><ul><li><i>Develop and adopt national best-practice guidelines for the provision of options counseling </i></li></ul><p>Adoption professionals reported providing information at a greater frequency than first/birth mothers reported receiving it. To counter the discrepancy between the agency professionals&#x2019; and first/birth mothers&#x2019; reported experiences surrounding different types of information, national guidelines should be developed and adopted that clearly delineate the specific information that should be discussed with expectant parents.</p><ul><li><i>Develop and adopt evidence-based written materials about options</i></li></ul><p>First/birth mothers reported varying degrees of access to written information about their options. Therefore, the provision of evidence-based written materials about all options should be established as a best practice. This material should be regulated, and perhaps developed at the national level to foster uniformity and reduce bias in the information provided to expectant parents.</p><ul><li><i>Inform expectant/new parents about available financial and housing resources</i></li></ul><p>Adoption professionals, particularly agency professionals/caseworkers, have a responsibility to ensure that expectant/new parents are aware of public and private assistance programs that can provide financial and housing support. Greater information about social services could help reduce the financial pressures that ultimately lead some parents to relinquish their parental rights to their child for adoption.</p><ul><li><i>Establish Best Practice Guidelines for Education and Therapeutic Work with Expectant Parents&#x2019; Families</i></li></ul><p>Providing education and family counseling to expectant parents and their family members might provide a neutral forum for families to address miscommunications, needs, and emotional strains resulting from the pregnancy, which might allow family members to be a better support to the expectant parents&#x2019; during the decision-making process. Additionally, education about community resources could allay families&#x2019; fears that expectant parents would not be able to support their child.</p><p>This project was underwritten by DAI&#x2019;s Lynn Franklin Fund with initial funding by James Stevens. Brenda Romanchik, LCSW, ACSW, CTS and author of <i>A Birthparent&#x2019;s Book of Memories</i> and other publications) served as the Project Lead. The Lynn Franklin Fund Advisory Council provided invaluable insight throughout this project. Phase II of the report consists of a subsample of the larger study for in-depth analysis regarding the opinions of first/birth parents and adoption professionals for what should be discussed and offered to parents seeking information on adoption. It will be released in Spring 2017.</p><p>Read the full Phase 1 report by visiting <a href=\"http://www.adoptioninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Understanding-Options-Counseling-Experiences-in-Adoption-Phase-One-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><strong><em>-- Written by Antwan Williams</em></strong></p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The Donaldson Adoption Institute</span></b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p><p>Since 1996, The Donaldson Adoption Institute has been on a mission to improve the lives of children and families through research, education and advocacy.

Photo courtesy of Laura Mydlarz.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>A biologist from The University of Texas at Arlington is leading a new study aimed at quantifying how susceptible coral species are to disease by examining their immunity through a series of novel experiments and approaches.</p><p>Laura Mydlarz, associate professor of biology, is principal investigator of the project, titled <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1712134&amp;HistoricalAwards=false\"><i>&#x201C;Immunity to Community: Can Quantifying Immune Traits Inform Reef Community Structure?&#x201D;</i></a> and funded by a two-year, $220,331 grant from the National Science Foundation&#x2019;s Division of Ocean Sciences. Co-principal investigators are Marilyn Brandt, research associate professor of marine and environmental science at the University of the Virgin Islands, and Erinn Muller, staff scientist at the Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium in Sarasota, Fla.</p><p>During the past three decades, environmental changes &#x2013; including global warming &#x2013; have likely led to the sharp increase in coral disease in reefs around the world. Unhealthy coral reefs cannot support the fish and other forms of life that make reefs such vibrant and diverse ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea are disease hotspots and many reefs have experienced population collapses due to outbreaks of disease, Mydlarz explained. Coral species vary in their susceptibility to disease, but the reasons behind this variation are unknown.</p><p>&#x201C;Coral diseases don&#x2019;t affect all coral species in a reef the same,&#x201D; Mydlarz said. &#x201C;Some coral are more susceptible to certain diseases. A reef is made up of many different species of coral. If a disease kills off one species of coral in a reef, that&#x2019;s going to greatly affect the reef community as a whole. We want to learn why some coral species are more tolerant of certain diseases.&#x201D;</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/laura-mydlarz-2-022417.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>From left, Marilyn Brant, Laura Mydlarz and Erinn Muller are collaborating on the project. Photo courtesy of Laura Mydlarz.&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>The project will focus on coral reefs in the Caribbean off the U.S. Virgin Islands. The site was chosen due to the high diversity of coral found there and the presence of &#x201C;white plague&#x201D; disease, which can cause rapid tissue loss in corals, affects many coral species and can cause partial or total colony mortality.</p><p>The project will use immune-challenge experiments that will quantify novel components of the innate immune system of corals, coupled with the application of a trait-based model, to fulfill three goals, Mydlarz said.</p><p>The first is to determine variability of coral immune traits in seven common coral species found on Caribbean reefs; the second is to determine the variability in resistance to white plague disease transmission in the same coral species; and the third is to develop a predictive model of coral community assemblage that incorporates immune traits.</p><p>The coral species which will be examined differ in disease susceptibility, growth rates and reproductive strategies. Susceptibility to white plague disease will be measured by exposing the corals to active white plague and calculating disease transmission rates in a laboratory setting. The immune responses of each species will be measured by exposing samples to bacterial immune stimulators. Samples will be collected and injected with lipopolysaccharides, which are molecules that elicit strong immune responses in some organisms.</p><p>&#x201C;We want to see the coral in its natural state and in an immune-stimulated state,&#x201D; Mydlarz said.</p><p>The immune response and disease transmission data for each coral species will be used to develop a predictive model to determine how different coral communities will respond to disease threats under climate change scenarios, she said.</p><p>Mydlarz traveled to the Virgin Islands in October to visit the site where the research will be done and to meet with Brandt. She plans to return in June along with some of the graduate students from her laboratory to collect samples and conduct experiments.</p><p>Clay Clark, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Biology, said the project is an example of the important work Mydlarz is doing to shed more light on the ties between climate change and the delicate ecosystems which have been adversely affected by that change. He noted that her research is a prime example of global environmental impact, which is one of the four pillars of the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020 Bold Solutions|Global Impact.</a></p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Mydlarz has been studying how environmental changes are affecting the ability of coral to fight disease for years and has contributed a great deal to our knowledge of coral immunity,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;This research will add to that knowledge and help us to better inform and encourage conservation.&#x201D;</p><p>The research will be highlighted at outreach events in Texas, Florida and the Virgin Islands, including Earth Day Texas 2017, scheduled for April 22 at Fair Park in Dallas; the Living Reef Exhibit and Aquarium at Mote Marine Laboratory; and Reef Fest and agricultural fairs at Coral World Ocean Park in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p>Mydlarz earned bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s of science degrees in Marine Biology from Florida Atlantic University in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and received her doctorate in Marine Science from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2004. She did postdoctoral work in ecology at Cornell University from 2004-06 before joining UTA in 2006. Much of the research in her lab focuses on coral immunity and disease.</p><p align=\"right\">-&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; By Greg Pederson, contributing writer</p><p><b>About the College of Science</b></p><p>The UTA College of Science is addressing the nation&#x2019;s pressing need for a larger and better-prepared STEM workforce.

Kribs is also an expert in mathematical epidemiology with research supported by the National Science Foundation.&#xA0;</p><p>The study showed that students who are failing at two or more subjects are at risk for dropping out, largely due to their increased interactions with other failing students.</p><p>&#x201C;Positive parenting is clearly very important for students but the study discovered that there is a point where negative peer influences overcome positive parental influences,&#x201D; Kribs said.</p><p>&#x201C;We feel there is a real opportunity to intervene at the school level to reduce dropout rates by controlling negative influences,&#x201D; he added.</p><p>The study looked at 125 students at a struggling high school in Chicago. The researchers surveyed the students on whether they were failing in core subjects such as mathematics, English, science and social sciences, the degree of parental involvement in their life and the number of failing and dropout friends of each student during the last year.</p><p>The mathematical model they developed defined students as being in one of two environments: a non-risky environment, where they are passing all core subjects or failing one and considered vulnerable; or a risky environment, where they are failing two or more core subjects and could drop out.</p><p>The data suggests that as the degree of parental involvement in a vulnerable student&#x2019;s life increases, the number of their failing friends decreases.</p><p>If the student is already failing two core courses and in the risky zone, the effectiveness of parental involvement changes: the number of their failing friends initially decreases, but then increases again. This may occur if students become more rebellious to a sudden increase in parental involvement at the same time they are receiving negative peer pressure from other failing students.</p><p>&#x201C;Parental guidance is a significant factor only when students are under a low level of negative social influence at school,&#x201D; Kribs said. &#x201C;If negative social influence increases beyond a critical value, the impact of parental influence becomes negligible. To manage dropout levels, we need to manage social influences at school.&#x201D;</p><p>The paper concludes that making sure that vulnerable and failing students are not only mixing with other failing and dropout students could achieve a sustained reduction in dropout rates.</p><p>Jianzhong Su, UTA mathematics chair, emphasized the importance of this project within the strategic theme of data-driven discovery within UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions, Global Impact. </a></p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Kribs&#x2019; work shows the relevance of mathematical studies to real-life social issues and demonstrates the importance of cross-disciplinary studies on social problems,&#x201D; Su said. &#x201C;The next step would be to roll the model out with larger groups of students to further demonstrate its accuracy and efficacy to education policymakers to make a real difference.&#x201D;</p><p>Kribs collaborated on this study with Anuj Mubayi, assistant professor of applied mathematics in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change as well as in the Simon&#xA0;A.&#xA0;Levin Mathematical Computational Modeling Science Center at Arizona State University-Tempe; Bechir Amdouni, developmental mathematics instructor at Northeastern Illinois University and Marlio Paredes, mathematics professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey.</p><p>The full study, <a href=\"http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/473/2197/20160204\">&#x201C;Why do students quit school?

Reforms that seek to upend these arrangements are highly unlikely to make it through Congress.&#x201D;</p><p>Sledge said that many attempts at national health insurance have failed because the melding of health policy with individual medicine have not been property understood.</p><p>&#x201C;The book shows how the distinct politics of the formative years of health policy &#x2013; and the presence of debilitating diseases in the American South &#x2013; led to outcomes that have fundamentally shaped modern policies and disputes,&#x201D; Sledge said. &#x201C;Until the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, health care in the United States was seen as a local issue with the sole exception being the government&#x2019;s role in providing care to seamen and immigrants.&#x201D;</p><p><i>Health Divided</i> argues that the health problems that plagued the American South in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, from malaria to hookworm and pellagra, along with the political power of the southern Democrats during the New Deal, fueled the emergence of national intervention in public health work.</p><p>At the same time, divisions among policymakers, as well as the resistance of the American Medical Association, led to federal inaction in the realm of individual medical services, which set the stage for the growth of employer-sponsored health insurance.</p><p>&#x201C;This is so timely as Congress struggles with health care, how to make it more accessible and affordable,&#x201D; Elisabeth Cawthon, interim dean of the College of Liberal Arts. &#x201C;Dr. Sledge has an extensive research background in health care and health policy.

Imbalances in this enzyme&#x2019;s activity can cause too many cells to be killed and not enough to be made, which is the case for arthritis and diabetes. &#xA0;Currently, the activity level required for cell death is undefined, which means that regulating these enzymes continues to be an issue for health professionals.&#xA0;</p><p>To facilitate research on the link between enzyme activity and cell development and cell death, the UTA researchers developed a database of caspase-3 mutations that demonstrate different levels of activity, and focused in on the enzyme&#x2019;s reactions with water molecules within the cell.</p><p>&#x201C;Our analysis of water molecules in the database, combined with structural and dynamic studies, showed that removing water molecules deactivates the enzyme,&#x201D; said Clay Clark, UTA chair of biology and leader of the study.</p><p>&#x201C;Genome-editing tools, combined with the database, should provide tools to fine-tune caspase-3 activity and allow us to develop new types of inhibitors for autoimmune diseases,&#x201D; he added.</p><p>The research was published this week in <i>The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> as <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/27/1603549113.abstract\">&#x201C;Tunable allosteric library of caspase-3 identifies coupling between conserved water molecules and conformational selection.&#x201D;</a> Clark was joined in this research by UTA&#x2019;s Joseph Maciag and Paul Swartz, Joshua Schipper, Matthew Tucker and Sarah Mackenzie from the Department of Molecular and Structural Biochemistry and the Center for Comparative Medicine and Translational Research at North Carolina State University.</p><p>The research provides a database of caspase-3 variants with nearly four different orders of magnitude change in activity, which will be far more effective for examining caspase-3 signaling than the current method known as &#x201C;knockdown&#x201D; or &#x201C;knockout strategies.&#x201D; &#x201C;Knockdown&#x201D; involves the complete inhibition of the enzyme and cannot explain different levels of activity.</p><p>The study also suggests that inhibitors that remove water molecules from the protein chains could effectively fine-tune caspase-3 activity by shifting the enzyme to an inactive state.</p><p>&#x201C;This method is applicable to all enzymes and could open up new possibilities for the sufferers of other diseases like cancer, through research that establishes the correct levels of enzyme activity to activate signaling processes that provoke the death of cancer cells,&#x201D; Clark said.</p><p>Morteza Khaledi, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Science, congratulated the researchers on this important advancement, which forms part of the university&#x2019;s increasing focus on <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a> within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Clark is a recognized leader in research on the potential therapeutic role of enzymes,&#x201D; Khaledi said. &#x201C;This high-level interdisciplinary research, between biophysics and biochemistry, is exactly the type of work that enables real discoveries and advances in science.&#x201D;</p><p>Clay Clark came to UTA in 2015 from North Carolina State University, where he led the biochemistry department. His lab studies protein design as well as cancer, neurodegenerative and auto-immune diseases. He has received continuous funding from sources such as the National Institutes for Health and the American Diabetes Association, among others.</p><p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of about 55,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.

I didn&#x2019;t know it was going to be an ad. I&#x2019;ve seen it in my high school, I&#x2019;ve seen it here, of course, on campus.

She said her experience there heightened her love for nursing.</p><p>&#x201C;I go in and help patients and families,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;I love the fact that I can make a difference.&#x201D;</p><p>Smith&#x2019;s mother Pamela, an administrative assistant, has worked at the College for nearly 20 years, making this a family event. Smith herself decided to become a nurse when she was in the sixth grade. Her mother was hospitalized following surgery and Smith was impressed by the professionalism and empathy of the nurses.</p><p>&#x201C;The nurses she had were really nice,&#x201D; Smith said. &#x201C;They had a lot of compassion. They interacted regularly with my mom, dad and grandmother. It&#x2019;s weird how life happens. It&#x2019;s almost like it was purposely done and set up or something before I even knew it.

Co-principal investigator Yeonho Park, a UTA faculty research associate, will be instrumental in implementing the pipes in the Texas projects.</p><p>The UTA-developed fiber-reinforced pipe meets an American Society for Testing and Materials specification for the first time ever. Abolmaali worked with industry associations and colleagues around the globe to establish that new standard &#x2013; ASTM C1818 Specification for Synthetic Fiber Reinforced Concrete Culvert, Storm Drain and Sewer Pipe &#x2013; last year.</p><p>The new standard describes a technically strong and durable reinforcement option that can be used for underground piping. The excellent, long-term performance of the concrete pipes reinforced with the polypropylene synthetic macrofiber was observed.</p><p>In addition to Abolmaali&#x2019;s team, the American Concrete Pipe Association, its members and Germany-based BASF Construction Chemicals collaborated on the project.</p><p>The $800,000 Texas contract is funded through the Texas Department of Transportation. A separate $283,000 contract is funded through the ACPA for developing 100-year service life protocols for synthetic fiber pipes for the Florida Department of Transportation.</p><p>Brian Barth, TxDOT&#x2019;s Fort Worth district engineer, said the state agency is excited about trying the new pipe standard.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re anxious to see how it does in wet-dry environments,&#x201D; Barth said. &#x201C;Many of the pilot areas are in rural spots where culverts run alongside the highway, which represent those wet-dry conditions. We&#x2019;ll see how the non-corrosive, fiber-reinforced pipes work in those environments.&#x201D;</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Pipes will be tested at UTA.\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/pipes2-abolmaali.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Pipes, reinforced with&#xA0;polypropylene synthetic macrofibers, will be produced and tested at UTA this semester as part of the TxDOT project.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Peter Crouch, UTA College of Engineering dean, said this is yet another remarkable example of academia working with industry.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Abolmaali and his team deserve a lot of credit for establishing a new American Society for Testing and Materials specification, setting a new national standard in construction that will have very tangible effects industry wide,&#x201D; Crouch said. &#x201C;His work makes substantial contributions to UTA&#x2019;s focus on&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/communities.php\">sustainable urban communities</a>&#xA0;contained within the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.&#x201D;</p><p>Several leading concrete pipe producers teamed up with UTA to produce more than 300 full-scale test pipes in different geographical locations within the U.S. with different concrete mix and equipment.</p><p>&#x201C;The UTA-developed fiber pipes first attracted the TxDOT engineers for implementation in Texas for a more durable and resilient infrastructure,&#x201D; Abolmaali said.</p><p>UTA and TxDOT will implement the UTA-developed fiber pipes under highways and roadways subjected to vehicle traffic, particularly at locations with junctions of multiple pipes and high underground water tables.</p><p>The pipes will be placed in series with conventional concrete pipes in multiple TxDOT construction projects for comparative evaluations.</p><p>Abolmaali&#x2019;s team will design, produce and evaluate both types of pipe. A UTA-owned robot will travel through the pipes after the construction to transmit condition assessment data. This evaluation will be conducted for three years so the UTA developed pipes can be tested in real TxDOT projects.</p><p>&#x201C;The UTA fiber pipes will not experience corrosion of reinforcement during its lifetime. That has and will continue to attract many departments of transportation around the county and the world,&#x201D; Abolmaali said. &#x201C;In addition to TxDOT, we are working with Florida Department of Transportation to implement the UTA fiber pipes in that state. Several other departments of transportation are joining or negotiating with UTA as well.&#x201D;</p><p>In addition to TxDOT grant, the American Concrete Pipe Association has awarded Abolmaali&#x2019;s team a $283,000 grant to develop the 100-year service life protocol testing criteria Florida&#x2019;s design specification.</p><p>This study includes accelerated aging of UTA-developed fiber pipes for up to 100 years by building a large pool and soaking the pipes in the pool with specific chemicals subjected to high temperature.</p><p>&#x201C;We can simulate the 100-year pipe conditions in only one year,&#x201D; Abolmaali said.</p><p>Abolmaali specializes in pipe construction and evaluation. He is currently performing an $882,000 performance evaluation on the city of Arlington&#x2019;s sewer pipes, and then prioritizing which pipes need mending immediately.</p><p>He also received a $600,000 grant from the Tarrant Regional Water District to simulate behavior and response of pipe-soil interaction that will surround the 150-mile Integrated Pipeline Project.</p><p>Abolmaali was recognized by ASTM with the Spangler Award, which is presented to a member of ASTM C13 who has been highly active technically on the committee, involving themselves in research, authoring research papers, and supplying data and knowledge which changes the existing standards and adds to the development of new standards.</p><p>ASTM C13, a committee with a membership of approximately 200, has jurisdiction over 55 national and international standards published in the Annual Book of ASTM Standards.</p><p><b>About The University of Texas at Arlington</b></p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution of about 55,000 students in campus-based and online degree programs and is the second-largest institution in The University of Texas System.
