Because of genetic differences between people, this immune response is unique to each individual.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This knowledge could be harnessed to treat diseases caused by an imbalance in the relationship between the host and the communities of bacteria in their intestine, otherwise known as gut dysbiosis,&#x201D; said Jason Kubinak, a new UTA assistant professor of biology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We can now imagine a world where oral vaccines or probiotics could be used to bolster natural defenses or control infection, reducing our need for long-term steroid or antibiotic use, both of which can have serious negative side-effects,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>Kubinak published the review paper, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nri/journal/v16/n12/full/nri.2016.114.html\">&#x201C;Do antibodies select a healthy microbiota?&#x201D;,</a> as the cover article of the prestigious journal <i>Nature Reviews: Immunology</i>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>He and his co-author June Round, associate professor of pathology at the University of Utah, termed this process by which the immune system releases antibodies to promote healthy microbial communities &#x201C;antibody-mediated immunoselection&#x201D; or AMIS.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We believe that going forward it will also be possible to develop immunotherapies based on antibodies that can manage bacterial communities to prevent illness,&#x201D; Kubinak said. &#x201C;This could be particularly important for more sensitive patients, such as those suffering diseases associated with primary or secondary immunodeficiencies.&quot;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/immunology-graphic.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Potential immunotherapies to modulate antibody-mediated immunoselection in the gut</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>In addition to their own research, Kubinak and Round reviewed a series of studies that demonstrate how the major gut antibody, called immunoglobulin A or IgA, targets resident bacteria and helps define the composition of bacterial communities in the intestine. Other studies show that immune-compromised mice without strong antibody responses develop unhealthy bacterial communities, and are more susceptibility to disease and bacterial invasion of their tissues.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;IgA-deficiency in humans has also been associated with gut dysbiosis and enhanced disease susceptibility,&quot; Kubinak said. &#x201C;Developing novel models of IgA deficiency will be crucial for dissecting the underlying genetic defects that result in gut dysbiosis as well as developing potential treatments.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The gut IgA antibody response serves a variety of positive functions, including limiting bacterial invasion of deeper tissues, reducing the severity of infection and limiting inflammation,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;This new field of research could have a large impact on human health.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Clay Clark, UTA chair of biology, underlined the importance of this research within the University&#x2019;s focus on health and the human condition within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact.</a></p>\n<p>&#x201C;This new line of research creates the opportunity to use the antibodies themselves to target microbes and harmful compounds, and would represent an important step forward in the fight against chronic and infectious diseases in the intestine,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;It is particularly important research as we see more and more resistance to antibiotics, which have traditionally been the first line of defense against many infections.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

Photo courtesy of Laura Mydlarz.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>A biologist from The University of Texas at Arlington is leading a new study aimed at quantifying how susceptible coral species are to disease by examining their immunity through a series of novel experiments and approaches.</p>\n<p>Laura Mydlarz, associate professor of biology, is principal investigator of the project, titled <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1712134&amp;HistoricalAwards=false\"><i>&#x201C;Immunity to Community: Can Quantifying Immune Traits Inform Reef Community Structure?&#x201D;</i></a> and funded by a two-year, $220,331 grant from the National Science Foundation&#x2019;s Division of Ocean Sciences. Co-principal investigators are Marilyn Brandt, research associate professor of marine and environmental science at the University of the Virgin Islands, and Erinn Muller, staff scientist at the Mote Marine Laboratory and Aquarium in Sarasota, Fla.</p>\n<p>During the past three decades, environmental changes &#x2013; including global warming &#x2013; have likely led to the sharp increase in coral disease in reefs around the world. Unhealthy coral reefs cannot support the fish and other forms of life that make reefs such vibrant and diverse ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea are disease hotspots and many reefs have experienced population collapses due to outbreaks of disease, Mydlarz explained. Coral species vary in their susceptibility to disease, but the reasons behind this variation are unknown.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Coral diseases don&#x2019;t affect all coral species in a reef the same,&#x201D; Mydlarz said. &#x201C;Some coral are more susceptible to certain diseases. A reef is made up of many different species of coral. If a disease kills off one species of coral in a reef, that&#x2019;s going to greatly affect the reef community as a whole. We want to learn why some coral species are more tolerant of certain diseases.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/laura-mydlarz-2-022417.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>From left, Marilyn Brant, Laura Mydlarz and Erinn Muller are collaborating on the project. Photo courtesy of Laura Mydlarz.&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The project will focus on coral reefs in the Caribbean off the U.S. Virgin Islands. The site was chosen due to the high diversity of coral found there and the presence of &#x201C;white plague&#x201D; disease, which can cause rapid tissue loss in corals, affects many coral species and can cause partial or total colony mortality.</p>\n<p>The project will use immune-challenge experiments that will quantify novel components of the innate immune system of corals, coupled with the application of a trait-based model, to fulfill three goals, Mydlarz said.</p>\n<p>The first is to determine variability of coral immune traits in seven common coral species found on Caribbean reefs; the second is to determine the variability in resistance to white plague disease transmission in the same coral species; and the third is to develop a predictive model of coral community assemblage that incorporates immune traits.</p>\n<p>The coral species which will be examined differ in disease susceptibility, growth rates and reproductive strategies. Susceptibility to white plague disease will be measured by exposing the corals to active white plague and calculating disease transmission rates in a laboratory setting. The immune responses of each species will be measured by exposing samples to bacterial immune stimulators. Samples will be collected and injected with lipopolysaccharides, which are molecules that elicit strong immune responses in some organisms.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We want to see the coral in its natural state and in an immune-stimulated state,&#x201D; Mydlarz said.</p>\n<p>The immune response and disease transmission data for each coral species will be used to develop a predictive model to determine how different coral communities will respond to disease threats under climate change scenarios, she said.</p>\n<p>Mydlarz traveled to the Virgin Islands in October to visit the site where the research will be done and to meet with Brandt. She plans to return in June along with some of the graduate students from her laboratory to collect samples and conduct experiments.</p>\n<p>Clay Clark, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Biology, said the project is an example of the important work Mydlarz is doing to shed more light on the ties between climate change and the delicate ecosystems which have been adversely affected by that change. He noted that her research is a prime example of global environmental impact, which is one of the four pillars of the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020 Bold Solutions|Global Impact.</a></p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Mydlarz has been studying how environmental changes are affecting the ability of coral to fight disease for years and has contributed a great deal to our knowledge of coral immunity,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;This research will add to that knowledge and help us to better inform and encourage conservation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The research will be highlighted at outreach events in Texas, Florida and the Virgin Islands, including Earth Day Texas 2017, scheduled for April 22 at Fair Park in Dallas; the Living Reef Exhibit and Aquarium at Mote Marine Laboratory; and Reef Fest and agricultural fairs at Coral World Ocean Park in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>\n<p>Mydlarz earned bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s of science degrees in Marine Biology from Florida Atlantic University in 1996 and 1998, respectively, and received her doctorate in Marine Science from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2004. She did postdoctoral work in ecology at Cornell University from 2004-06 before joining UTA in 2006.

The term &#x201C;modified&#x201D; describes the lower carbohydrate limit compared to Atkins recommendations and the emphasis of high fat foods as is required on the ketogenic diet.</li>\n<li>The existence of structural brain defects such as white matter abnormalities in one quarter of cases, as seen in MRI scans;</li>\n<li>The favorable impact of early diagnosis and treatment regardless of treatment modality and mutation type.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These results challenge the current approaches to the disease, such as the perceived absolute requirement of a ketogenic or high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, the assumed lack of structural brain defects and the potential existence of genotype: phenotype correlations.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Patients who were diagnosed early and put on an adequate diet did very well,&#x201D; Dr. Su said. &#x201C;Screening for this disease among babies with developmental delays or problems such as seizures within the first year of life could make a significant impact on outcomes.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The research was supported by a Service Package Grant from UT Southwestern&#x2019;s Center for Translational Medicine, which was given to the collaboration of Dr. Pascual&#x2019;s lab and Dr. Su&#x2019;s team to develop this analysis and additional research on individual patient&#x2019;s electroencephalogram or EEG imaging analysis to localize the sources of abnormal brain signals.</p>\n<p>Morteza Khaledi, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Science, underlined the importance of this work in the context of UTA&#x2019;s strategic themes of health and the human condition and data-driven discovery within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The work of Dr. Su&#x2019;s team in mathematical analysis gave the researchers the power to extract meaningful conclusions from large data sets with a very high level of rigor,&#x201D; Khaledi said. &#x201C;These trends and associations may not have been seen in other ways.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

Kribs is also an expert in mathematical epidemiology with research supported by the National Science Foundation.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The study showed that students who are failing at two or more subjects are at risk for dropping out, largely due to their increased interactions with other failing students.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Positive parenting is clearly very important for students but the study discovered that there is a point where negative peer influences overcome positive parental influences,&#x201D; Kribs said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We feel there is a real opportunity to intervene at the school level to reduce dropout rates by controlling negative influences,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>The study looked at 125 students at a struggling high school in Chicago. The researchers surveyed the students on whether they were failing in core subjects such as mathematics, English, science and social sciences, the degree of parental involvement in their life and the number of failing and dropout friends of each student during the last year.</p>\n<p>The mathematical model they developed defined students as being in one of two environments: a non-risky environment, where they are passing all core subjects or failing one and considered vulnerable; or a risky environment, where they are failing two or more core subjects and could drop out.</p>\n<p>The data suggests that as the degree of parental involvement in a vulnerable student&#x2019;s life increases, the number of their failing friends decreases.</p>\n<p>If the student is already failing two core courses and in the risky zone, the effectiveness of parental involvement changes: the number of their failing friends initially decreases, but then increases again. This may occur if students become more rebellious to a sudden increase in parental involvement at the same time they are receiving negative peer pressure from other failing students.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Parental guidance is a significant factor only when students are under a low level of negative social influence at school,&#x201D; Kribs said. &#x201C;If negative social influence increases beyond a critical value, the impact of parental influence becomes negligible. To manage dropout levels, we need to manage social influences at school.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The paper concludes that making sure that vulnerable and failing students are not only mixing with other failing and dropout students could achieve a sustained reduction in dropout rates.</p>\n<p>Jianzhong Su, UTA mathematics chair, emphasized the importance of this project within the strategic theme of data-driven discovery within UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions, Global Impact. </a></p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Kribs&#x2019; work shows the relevance of mathematical studies to real-life social issues and demonstrates the importance of cross-disciplinary studies on social problems,&#x201D; Su said. &#x201C;The next step would be to roll the model out with larger groups of students to further demonstrate its accuracy and efficacy to education policymakers to make a real difference.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Kribs collaborated on this study with Anuj Mubayi, assistant professor of applied mathematics in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change as well as in the Simon&#xA0;A.&#xA0;Levin Mathematical Computational Modeling Science Center at Arizona State University-Tempe; Bechir Amdouni, developmental mathematics instructor at Northeastern Illinois University and Marlio Paredes, mathematics professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey.</p>\n<p>The full study, <a href=\"http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/473/2197/20160204\">&#x201C;Why do students quit school?

Sledge said there has been a great deal of continuity in the American health care system since the 1960s, when the creation of Medicare and Medicaid helped to lock in a system underpinned by employer-sponsored health insurance.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Under slightly different circumstances, we could have ended up with far more extensive federal government involvement in providing access to health services,&#x201D; said Sledge, who specializes in health policy and politics at UTA. &#x201C;Beyond this, individual medical services might have been more closely integrated with preventive and public health efforts.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In addition, <i>Health Divided</i> portrays Obamacare as consistent with long-standing patterns in American health politics, with state-based exchanges and Medicaid expansion layered on top of the existing health care system.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption250\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/health-divided-cover.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;Future changes will likely remain consistent with these patterns, rather than overturning existing institutions,&#x201D; Sledge said. &#x201C;Going forward, we would expect effective&#xA0;change to occur within the framework of employer-sponsored health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and the state-based exchanges. Reforms that seek to upend these arrangements are highly unlikely to make it through Congress.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Sledge said that many attempts at national health insurance have failed because the melding of health policy with individual medicine have not been property understood.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The book shows how the distinct politics of the formative years of health policy &#x2013; and the presence of debilitating diseases in the American South &#x2013; led to outcomes that have fundamentally shaped modern policies and disputes,&#x201D; Sledge said. &#x201C;Until the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, health care in the United States was seen as a local issue with the sole exception being the government&#x2019;s role in providing care to seamen and immigrants.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><i>Health Divided</i> argues that the health problems that plagued the American South in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, from malaria to hookworm and pellagra, along with the political power of the southern Democrats during the New Deal, fueled the emergence of national intervention in public health work.</p>\n<p>At the same time, divisions among policymakers, as well as the resistance of the American Medical Association, led to federal inaction in the realm of individual medical services, which set the stage for the growth of employer-sponsored health insurance.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is so timely as Congress struggles with health care, how to make it more accessible and affordable,&#x201D; Elisabeth Cawthon, interim dean of the College of Liberal Arts. &#x201C;Dr. Sledge has an extensive research background in health care and health policy. Exploring the history behind its failure, and tracing the complicated links between public health and national health policy, <i>Health Divided</i> provides a valuable new perspective on the foundations of America&#x2019;s disjointed health care system.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The book is available on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Health-Divided-Individual-Medicine-American/dp/0700624317/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1493059282&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sledge+health+divided\">Amazon</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/health-divided-daniel-sledge/1125147267;jsessionid=3FFDD21C1BCC77C71C6769D8DFC4528B.prodny_store01-atgap10?ean=9780700624317\">Barnes and Noble</a>.</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington </span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

His project is titled &#x201C;CAREER: Does behavioral plasticity promote or constrain adaptation? A test using resurrection,&#x201D; and will address a long-standing question in evolutionary biology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We have known for at least 100 years that organisms are sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and that they will often alter the expression of their traits when conditions change,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Scientists have long speculated that this &#x2018;plasticity&#x2019; plays a key role in ultimate evolutionary responses, but how it does so is not clear. The challenge in answering this question is that you need to observe evolutionary changes as they occur.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The project will help answer the question by taking advantage of a unique feature of zooplankton biology, Walsh explained. Many species of zooplankton produce resting eggs when conditions deteriorate. A resting egg is an egg that undergoes a period of dormancy during which it is resistant to adverse conditions. These resting eggs sink to the bottom of lakes and accumulate. More importantly, they remain viable for decades or even longer.</p>\n<p>Walsh&#x2019;s research will focus on a system that experienced a recent change in environmental conditions. Lakes in Wisconsin were recently invaded by a dominant invertebrate predator, the spiny water flea or <i>Bythotrephes longimanus</i>. <i>Bythotrephes</i> has decimated populations of <i>Daphnia</i>, a tiny, shrimp-like crustacean also known as the water flea, as its diet consists mostly of <i>Daphnia</i> zooplankton. In previous research, Walsh provided evidence that <i>Bythotrephes</i> drives evolution in <i>Daphnia</i>.</p>\n<p>In his CAREER project, Walsh and students in his laboratory will &#x201C;resurrect&#x201D; historic resting eggs of <i>Daphnia</i> retrieved from Wisconsin lakes to observe this process as it transpired in nature. Successful resurrection of species is a relatively recent occurrence, having been developed within the past two decades.</p>\n<p>Comparisons across contemporary populations show that invasion by spiny water fleas is associated with rapid evolution of <i>Daphnia</i> prey, Walsh noted. Pairing &#x201C;resurrection&#x201D; experiments with experimental evolution in the lab will help determine if plasticity promotes or impedes adaptation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This work is important because it will allow us to observe evolutionary processes in real time and thus better understand how organisms adapt to any changes in environmental conditions, such as rising temperatures, habitat loss, or species invasions,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>Allowing him and his students to track the interplay between environmentally-induced trait responses and evolutionary changes in &quot;real time&quot; will provide novel insights into how organisms adapt to a change in the environment, including a test of the long-standing hypothesis regarding the role of behavior in evolution, the &#x2018;behavior evolves first&#x2019; hypothesis, Walsh said.</p>\n<p>College of Science Dean Morteza Khaledi said Walsh&#x2019;s project will help further strengthen the University&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact, specifically in the area of global environmental impact, one of the plan&#x2019;s core themes.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Congratulations to Dr. Walsh on this tremendous honor,&#x201D; Khaledi said. &#x201C;He is a wonderful example of the young faculty we have in the College of Science who are doing groundbreaking research while also providing innovative teaching in the classroom. It&#x2019;s very gratifying to see his efforts being recognized and rewarded with this prestigious award.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Walsh, who plans to begin collecting specimens from Wisconsin lakes for the study this summer, said he was surprised to learn he was receiving the CAREER award because it was his first time to submit for the grant. Competition for the awards is great and few first-time submissions are accepted.</p>\n<p>The CAREER award requires projects to have both research and teaching components, and Walsh&#x2019;s proposal combines research with an educational plan that will utilize zooplankton as a model to engage students with inquiry-based curricula and research-based courses. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>CAREER grants are the NSF&#x2019;s most prestigious awards in support of early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization. Activities pursued by early-career faculty should build a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research.</p>\n<p>Walsh received an M.S. in Marine and Atmospheric Sciences from Stony Brook University in 2003 and a Ph.D. in Evolution, Ecology, and Organismal Biology from the University of California at Riverside in 2009. He worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at Yale University from 2009-12 before coming to UTA in 2012. His research bridges the gap between community/ecosystem ecology and evolutionary biology to explore the reciprocity between ecological and evolutionary forces in natural populations. It addresses questions of broad ecological and evolutionary interest.</p>\n"

The C3 photosystem is typical of cereal grains like rice.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Ultimately, our goal is to genetically modify C3 staple crops, such as rice, to use C4 photosynthesis and increase their photosynthetic efficiency,&#x201D; Glenn said.</p>\n<p>Turning rice, the world&#x2019;s food staple, into a C4 plant like maize could have significant global benefits towards improving&#xA0;food security. Some scientists estimate that C4&#xA0;rice could produce up to 50% more grain&#x2014;and be able to do it with less water and nutrients.</p>\n<p>At the end of her Danforth fellowship, Glenn received an award for best project and was selected to present her research at the NSF REU Symposium in Washington, D.C. in October 2015. Her mentor presented her project results at the 58th Annual Maize Genetics Conference in Jacksonville, Fla., in March 2016.</p>\n<p>Following her junior year, Glenn was selected for an REU fellowship at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. She studied the interaction between the pathogen Erwinia amylovora, potential insect vectors, and apple trees. Erwinia amylovora is a bacterial phytopathogen that causes fire blight disease in apples and other rosaceous plants. Research suggests that fire blight can be transmitted by insects but in-depth knowledge describing interactions between the pathogen and potential vectors is lacking, Glenn said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My primary goal was to design a project which would increase our understanding of the baseline interactions between a potential vector &#x2014; the fruit fly&#x2014; and the pathogen,&#x201D; Glenn said.</p>\n<p>Glenn is also a member of the UTA Honors College, is co-president at the University Catholic Center and is lead resident assistant at Vandergriff Hall. In addition, she&#x2019;s a standout member of the UTA track and field team, where she has competed in the pole vault since her freshman year.</p>\n<p>Olawoyin received a bachelor&#x2019;s in mathematics with honors from UTA in May 2015 and entered graduate school the following fall. Her doctoral research is based in mathematical biology, which uses mathematics to describe the spread of infectious diseases and can be used to model vector-borne diseases. Her faculty advisor is Christopher Kribs, a UTA professor of mathematics who specializes in mathematical biology to research the spread of diseases such as Chagas and West Nile virus through the use of differential equations to model population and infection dynamics.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Mayowa is an exceptional student,&#x201D; Kribs said. &#x201C;She completed research projects in two different fields while still an undergraduate at UTA, and the resulting reports have both been submitted for publication in journals. Last summer she completed a third project, on the spread of chikungunya virus along transportation networks in Ecuador, and has made a good start on modeling difference transmission routes for the Zika virus, her dissertation project, for which she obtained NSF support. I&apos;m lucky to be working with her.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Olawoyin is a fellow in the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation Bridge to Doctorate program, which is funded by the NSF and aims to recruit, retain, and graduate higher numbers of under-represented minority STEM or science, technology, engineering and mathematics professionals.</p>\n<p>She serves on the student chapters&#x2019; committee and is national chapter liaison for the UTA chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics and also serves as secretary for the UTA chapter of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.</p>\n<p>She got her start in biological mathematics as an undergraduate, as part of UTA&#x2019;s Undergraduate Training in Theoretical and Ecological Research program. The two-year program includes mentoring, seminars, research, and specially designed interdisciplinary coursework. It brings biology and math students together to discover new ways that infections could be translated into a system of equations.</p>\n<p>As an undergraduate Olawoyin was a member of the UTA Honors College and was a McNair Scholar, a Gates Millennium Scholar and a Richard Greene Scholar. She served as president of the UTA chapter of AWM and as treasurer of the Lambda Chi Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, a public service sorority.</p>\n<p>After receiving her bachelor&#x2019;s in Mathematics in 2015, Olawoyin created the UTA Diversity Regional Enhancement in STEM Scholarship, which goes to an incoming UTA student from an area school district who is Hispanic or African-American and wants to pursue a degree in a STEM field. She contributes $1,000 a year to fund the scholarship.</p>\n<p>She has presented her research at numerous conferences, including the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science, the National Diversity in STEM Conference in Long Beach, California and the Mathematical and Theoretical Biology Institute, a summer research program at Arizona State University.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Receiving this fellowship made me pause and think about how far I have come academically,&#x201D; Olawoyin said. &#x201C;It also made me think about the responsibility that I have to make outstanding research contributions to my field of study.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

Lim, Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Cincinnati (UC), will be the next Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs of UTA, announced today by President Vistasp Karbhari.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lim, whose appointment takes effect June 30, 2017, is an experienced leader, accomplished scholar and innovator. Since 2012, Dr. Lim served as the 19<sup>th</sup> Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Cincinnati, overseeing significant growth in enrollment, reputation, faculty size, corporate partnerships, research funding and endowments. A strong believer in collaboration, Dean Lim established a unique UC Simulation Center funded by P&amp;G that now supports 75 research students from 5 colleges at the University of Cincinnati and was replicated at 3 other global sites, and strengthened the partnership between the College of Engineering and Applied Science, the College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children&#x2019;s Hospital through an interdisciplinary biomedical engineering initiative.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Lim also enhanced the University&#x2019;s global engagement programs including the establishment of a signature professional dual Master&#x2019;s degree with international partners in Europe and Asia, and the Joint Engineering Co-op Institute in partnership with Chongqing University in China &#x2013; the first such mandatory co-op program in the country for engineers. As an advocate for entrepreneurship, he not only strengthened the highly regarded UC cooperative education program, but also significantly enhanced it to focus on the innovation economy.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The selection committee was extremely impressed with Dr. Teik C. Lim&#x2019;s depth of experience and established record of devising innovative ways of addressing conventional challenges in a university environment,&#x201D; said Duane Dimos, Vice President for Research at UTA and chair of the search committee. As dean, Dr. Lim focused on substantially enhancing student success at the undergraduate and graduate levels though programmatic and curricular advances, increased the emphasis on innovation and entrepreneurship in engineering instruction, and strengthened interdisciplinary research through the establishment of data analytics and water research clusters.</p>\n<p>He led the expansion of the college&#x2019;s Emerging Ethnic Engineering (E3) program to promote minority student participation and success in STEM fields. He also directed a faculty hiring campaign that focused on diversity and multidisciplinary skills, resulting in close to 50 new teaching and research faculty over 3 years, substantially increasing the College&#x2019;s representation of women and underrepresented faculty.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The Committee selected Dr. Lim from a deep pool of distinguished candidates&#x201D; said search committee member Teresa Doughty, Dean of the UTA College of Education. &#x201C;Dr. Lim&#x2019;s success in leading interdisciplinary and collaborative initiatives and his expertise in so many areas in which UTA is already excelling, particularly in championing diversity of student body and faculty, made him the ideal selection to contribute to our continued upward trajectory.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m thrilled to welcome Dr. Lim to UTA and would like to thank the search committee for recruiting an exceptional scholar, researcher, and advocate of collaboration and global engagement,&#x201D; said President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;His dedication to excellence and student success along with his proactive and highly successful record in engagement with the corporate world and with the local and global community make him the ideal candidate to continue our drive to ever higher levels of excellence.&#x201C;</p>\n<p>Lim will work in close partnership with the President to provide overall leadership for the campus. As Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs he will oversee academic administration and student success programs, and direct reports will include the Deans of the academic units and other areas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are most indebted to outgoing Provost Ron Elsenbaumer for his many years of excellent service to The University of Texas at Arlington,&#x201D; said Karbhari. &#x201C;His contributions have been key to the tremendous progress we have made and will leave a lasting impression on this great university.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s aspiration to become the Model 21<sup>st</sup> Century Urban Research University, an institution on the move, and the excellent team President Karbhari has assembled are what attracted me to this position,&#x201D; said Dr. Lim.&#xA0; &#x201C;The University already has all the necessary elements to achieve its ambition &#x2013; enrollment growing by leaps and bounds; a very diverse student body; and a campus situated in a thriving, dynamic and very large Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex with strong global connections. I believe my experiences position me well to collaborate with the deans and faculty effectively, and to support UTA&#x2019;s commitment to access and excellence.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Peter E. Landgren, Interim Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost at UC, noted that while the loss of an accomplished colleague to another institution is always sad, &#x201C;It is joyous when someone of the interdisciplinary and interpersonal talents as Teik C. Lim is recognized for greater leadership potential. I know I speak for many at the University of Cincinnati in thanking Dean Lim for advancing the College of Engineering and Applied Science in multiple ways, and wishing him the best in his new role as Provost at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dr. Lim earned his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Michigan Technological University, his Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla, and his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at the Ohio State University.</p>\n<p>He worked as a Project Engineer and Senior Engineer at Structural Dynamics Research Corporation before joining The Ohio State University Center for Automotive Research as a research scientist. He taught at the University of Alabama beginning in 1998 as Associate Professor before joining the University of Cincinnati in 2002, where he advanced from Associate Professor, Professor and Department Head of Mechanical Engineering to Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Research and, ultimately, Dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science. He served as Chair of the Council of Deans in 2015-16.</p>\n<p>Dr. Lim is a Fellow of ASME &#x2013; the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and of SAE &#x2013; the Society of Automotive Engineers, from which he received numerous research and teaching awards such as the Arch T. Colwell Merit Award in 2003 and the Ralph R. Teetor Educational Award in 2002.

Tran typically prefers to write non-fiction pieces, and noted that when he heard about events in Yemen &#x201C;I felt this sense of outrage.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">Tran is majoring in Critical Languages focusing on Russian language, and minoring in English with a specialization in Creative Writing.</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">The University of Texas System Board of Regents established the annual Regents&#x2019; Outstanding Arts and Humanities Awards in February 2012. The honor was created to foster excellence in student performance, reward outstanding students, stimulate the arts and humanities and promote continuous quality in education, according to the University of Texas System&#x2019;s Office of Academic Affairs. The focus of the award rotates each year among fields in the fine arts and humanities. Tran is the third UTA undergraduate student to be honored in this annual competition.&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">This year, Tran is only one of two students recognized by the selection committee, comprised of experts in creative writing from outside the UT System. In each of the two creative writing categories, Poetry and Short Fiction, up to three submissions from each of the 14 Institutions in the UT System were considered based on a command of language, structure and originality.</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">Tran emphasized that he would not have submitted &#x201C;Airstrikes&#x201D; to the Regents&#x2019; competition if Professor Laura Kopchick, a senior lecturer in the English Department and Creative Writing Coordinator, had not encouraged him.</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">&#x201C;I wrote the story for her Introduction to Creative Writing class and I was not in love with it then,&#x201D; Tran admits. He labored through a dozen drafts before he finalized the short story. He recalled how Kopchick helped him through that process, especially with the story&#x2019;s ending.</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">&#x201C;I had written this convenient ending that I was not thrilled about,&#x201D; Tran said. &#x201C;She told me that a story doesn&apos;t need a neat bow to wrap itself up, and that somehow clicked in my brain.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Kopchick said, &#x201C;What is wonderful about Frederick is that not only is he a talented writer, he&#x2019;s also willing to put in the difficult hours of revision necessary in creating a polished short story.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">Tran believes that his selection for this honor reflects well on UTA&#x2019;s College of Liberal Arts.</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">&#x201C;I couldn&apos;t have written this story without the knowledge I gained here&#x2014;whether that be the writing styles I studied in Russian literature, the techniques we learned in creative writing or the French&#xA0;I was fortunate to pick up through the language courses,&#x201D; Tran said of the honor. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a testament to the outstanding faculty we have in the College of Liberal Arts here at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">Elisabeth Cawthon, interim dean of the College of Liberal Arts, noted that the college boasts award-winning professors who delight in mentoring students.&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">&#x201C;Professor Kopchick and the entire Department of English assist students in finding their voices through writing,&#x201D; Cawthon said. &#x201C;These talented faculty members instill in students the confidence to submit their creative efforts for publication and recognition.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"m-5637451101092449694p1\">The Board of Regents will present Tran with his award May 10 in Austin.

The mortality rate for these patients is high and the cardinal feature among them is impaired exercise tolerance. While evidence based drug&#xA0;therapies improve&#xA0;survival in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction, they do not&#xA0;improve survival in HFpEF patients, Haykowsky said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are looking at peripheral non-cardiac factors that affect exercise tolerance and their improvement with exercise training,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;In HFpEF patients, we believe that the muscle sympathetic activity is over active. We will also be measuring HFpEF patients&#x2019; cardiorespiratory fitness, aerobic endurance, functional performance and quality of life.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Haykowsky will work with several leading heart disease researchers from the college on this study, including Paul Fadel, a professor, neural cardio-vascular control expert and the college&#x2019;s associate dean for research; Michael Nelson, an assistant professor of kinesiology, who is studying a frequently misdiagnosed heart condition in women; and Kathryn Daniel and Daisha Cipher, both associate professors in the college.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>They will study HFpEF patients and healthy controls who are 60 and older. The HFpEF patients will then be randomly assigned to two exercise training groups. One group will meet at UTA for exercise sessions three days a week for 16 weeks. The second group will be a control group. Researchers will strive to improve the muscle sympathetic nerve activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, aerobic endurance and functional performance and quality of life. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This grant is a huge win for our research faculty, for the college and for the University of Texas at Arlington,&#x201D; said Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation. &#x201C;The study conducted by Professor Haykowsky and his team of seasoned researchers will make a significant contribution to the body of knowledge on heart disease and help us get to the bottom of some heart ailments that continue to elude us.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About the UTA College of Nursing and Health Innovation</span></b></p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/index.php\">College of Nursing and Health Innovation</a> is a National League for Nursing Center of Excellence and encompasses one of the nation&#x2019;s largest and most successful nursing schools and a renowned kinesiology program offering degrees in exercise science, kinesiology, athletic training and an undergraduate track in public health.

Specifically, the work addresses how eyes and brains among populations of killifish, Rivulus hartii, found in the waters of the Caribbean off the island of Trinidad.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Understanding how complex traits have evolved is a long-standing goal in evolutionary biology and the complex structure of the eye is frequently presented as an example of evolution that challenges the understanding of evolution by natural selection,&#x201D; Beston said.</p>\n<p>While eye size varies extensively across species, there are very few studies that have evaluated how eyes evolve within a single species, she explained. Increases in eye size are associated with improved vision. As a result, shifts in eye size are likely connected, and potentially driven, by a variety of ecological factors, such as foraging, avoiding predators, and identifying mates.&#xA0;<i>Rivulus</i>&#xA0;are found in fish communities on the island that vary in predation intensity, ranging from sites where they are preyed upon by large fish to sites where they are the only species present.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My most recent work, and the basis of the research I have proposed in the DDIG, has shown that increases in predation are associated with genetically based decreases in eye size,&#x201D; Beston said. &#x201C;This work provides a clear link between an ecological driver of eye size evolution, but it does not establish causation. We still do not know why predators appear to select for a smaller eye size in Rivulus.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Beston hopes that the research she has proposed in the DDIG will begin to provide answers that establish a causal link between predators and prey eye size, rather than just a correlational relationship. The work she proposed involves a series of mark-recapture experiments where individual&#xA0;<i>Rivulus</i>&#xA0;specimens can be tracked both from populations with predators and without predators to look at how eye size correlates with variables like survival and growth rate.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I also plan to complete perturbation experiments in the lab and in nature,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;These approaches will evaluate how natural selection is operating on eye size and will also allow us to experimentally test the influence of predators on eye size in Rivulus.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Matthew Walsh, UTA assistant professor of biology, said the funding will allow Beston to perform &#x201C;ambitious, manipulative experiments in nature that have the potential to provide novel insights into how the vertebrate eye evolves.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Shannon has shown tremendous growth as a Ph.D. student at UTA and is always willing to go the extra mile in the field and lab,&#x201D; Walsh said. &#x201C;Her selection as a recipient of an NSF grant reflects the success she has achieved to date as well as the strong potential for continued success thereafter.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Beston plans to return to Trinidad to collect more specimens in August and December, as well as making several return trips in 2018, which will be paid for by her DDIG award.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p align=\"right\">-&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; By Greg Pederson, contributing writer</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About The University of Texas at Arlington</span></b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

Those pins strengthen the failing soil and in turn the highways, putting off or eliminating the need to repair the roads.</p>\n<p>Hossain&#x2019;s research, funded in prior years by the Texas Department of Transportation, has helped lead toward his publishing a book titled: &#x201C;Sustainable Slope Stabilisation using Recycled Plastic Pins,&#x201D; which will release on&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.crcpress.com/Sustainable-Slope-Stabilization-using-Recycled-PlasticPin/Hossain/p/book/9781138636101\">CRC Press</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sustainable-Slope-Stabilisation-Recycled-Plastic/dp/113863610X/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494861715&amp;sr=8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords=recycled+plastic+pins+for+slope+stabilization\">Amazon</a>&#xA0;on June 6.</p>\n<p>Sadik Khan and Golam Kibria, two of Hossain&#x2019;s research team members, who received their doctorates in civil engineering, were co-authors on the book. Khan is working as an assistant professor at Jackson State University in Mississippi. Kibria is working for a San Antonio-based consulting company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hossain said repair and maintenance due to highway slope failures cost millions of dollars each year in the United States. He said highway slope failures usually happen at a depth of less than 10 feet.</p>\n<p>Hossain credits the clay content of many North Texas soils for contributing to the highway slope dilemma. Cracks eventually appear in these slopes and create paths for rainwater to seep into those slopes. That water increases pressure on the slope, decreases soil strength and eventually could lead to highway failure.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Plastic, being non-degradable, is problematic if discarded into landfills as they occupy large volumes of landfill space and remain in the landfill for a long period. However, due to the same non-degradable nature, plastic can be very useful and beneficial for civil engineering infrastructure projects,&#x201D; Hossain said.</p>\n<p>The use of recycled plastic pins made out of recycled plastic bottles, for highway slope stabilization and civil engineering infrastructure projects, demonstrates a perfect example of sustainable engineering solutions.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Sahadat Hossain\" id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/hossain-portrait1.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Sahadat Hossain</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;We also want to add the recycled plastic pins to soil bases and retaining walls to increase the bearing capacity of foundation soils,&#x201D; Hossain said. &#x201C;We can achieve the same positive impact with the pins in these new areas.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The research has led to soil stabilization on some Dallas County highways.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The slope reinforced with recycled plastic pins along U.S. 287 has been performing quite well compared to the control section and a slope that failed across the roadway,&#x201D; said Nicasio Lozano, who leads the Geotechnical Division of TxDOT Dallas District&#x2019;s Bridge Section. &#x201C;The repair cost of the failed slope runs over a million dollars. The book illustrates a method to stabilize certain slope failures economically and in an environmentally friendly way.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The research and book further UTA&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">Strategic Plan&#xA0;<i>Bold Solutions | Global Impact</i></a>, especially in the theme of fostering&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/communities.php\">livable sustainable communities</a>&#xA0;theme, a key tenet of that strategic plan.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

These peptides bind with cell surface proteins known as the major histocompatibility complex or MHC, which plays an important role in immune response.</p>\n<p>In cancer cells, the protein compositions are different. By identifying the specific peptides that bind to MHC in cancer cells, it is possible to establish biomarkers for the disease and develop new cancer therapies.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/screen-shot-2017-05-22-at-30818-pm.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Image showing how the immune or T cell receptor like antibodies, known as TCR-like antibodies, target cancer cells.

Another possibility would be for the T cell receptor-like antibodies to be used to genetically modify immune cells to attack these specific intracellular targets.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Jon Weidanz recently demonstrated the effectiveness of his modified T cell receptor or TCR-like antibody-drug complexes against cancer in a new paper, &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28273004\">TCR-like antibody drug conjugates mediate killing of tumor cells with low peptide/HLA targets</a>,&#x201D; which was published in mAbs, an international journal that focuses on antibodies.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our data showed proof-of-concept results for our TCR-like antibody coupled with a cytotoxic drug to kill tumor cells,&#x201D; Jon Weidanz added. &#x201C;Efforts are now underway to improve clinical efficiency by improving the properties of this conjugate therapy, which enables sensitive discrimination between healthy and diseased tissue.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>AbeXXa Biologics is housed at the Shimadzu Institute for Research Technologies in the NanoFab Building on the UTA campus, and already has 12 employees. The company is also setting up an office and laboratory at LabCentral in Cambridge, Mass., after winning a Massachusetts Biotechnology Council- sponsored Innovation Day competition earlier this year. Two of the new employees are UTA doctoral students and the company has also hired an intern for the summer from the College of Business.</p>\n<p>Duane Dimos, UTA vice president of research, underlined the increased role of start-ups as part of the entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem developing on campus.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;AbeXXa Biologics is already one of the largest users of Shimadzu Institute for Research Technologies equipment and is fully integrated in the UTA community, creating new opportunities for graduate students and even our business school students,&#x201D; Dimos said.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;Going forward, we expect to see many more UTA research initiatives move out of the lab and into the marketplace,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Penson Endowed Professor of Clinical Health Psychology.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>A leading psychology professor at The University of Texas at Arlington has focused international attention on how a chronic pain patient&#x2019;s irrational doubts about never getting better can influence both his reactions to pain and even treatment outcomes.</p>\n<p>Chronic&#xA0;pain costs the U.S. up to $635 billion each year in medical treatment and lost productivity, and is considered a problem of epidemic proportions. &#xA0;The influence of these irrational beliefs on both patient behavior and chronic pain treatment success is of growing interest to the scientific community.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are seeing that patients who tend to have these irrational beliefs are at greater risk of misusing opioid medicines and take longer to return to work when experiencing work disability for acute lower back pain,&#x201D; said Robert J.&#xA0; Gatchel, UTA Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Nancy P. &amp; John G. Penson Endowed Professor of Clinical Health Psychology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A more complete treatment model around this problem would promote changes in lifestyle habits and attitudes, and strengthen social support systems, alongside medical treatments. We need to take into consideration a series of treatment components that people have not considered before,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>The irrational or maladaptive beliefs that the pain will never get better are clinically known as pain catastrophizing. Gatchel has edited one of the first special issues dedicated to this subject for this month&#x2019;s<a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jabr.12088/abstract\"> Journal of Applied Biobehavioral Research</a>, bringing together new studies from Asia, Europe and North America, as well as his recent review of the literature.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We hope that this special issue will spark more interest in this significant construct and help guide further clinical research,&#x201D; Gatchel said. &#x201C;New research on brain imaging and the genetics of catastrophizing are highlighting the increased complexity of these beliefs and underline the need for a more complete model for pain treatment.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Perry Fuchs, UTA&#x2019;s chair of psychology, congratulated Gatchel on this achievement and his research program, which contributes to the University&#x2019;s strategic theme of Health and the Human Condition within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There is a long history of evaluating the cognitive appraisal of pain on therapeutic outcomes and Dr. Gatchel&#x2019;s analysis of catastrophizing and comprehensive treatment approaches highlights certain aspects of why patients might feel less pain, why some patients recover faster, and how some better manage their conditions,&#x201D; &#xA0;Fuchs said.</p>\n<p>Additional work in the UTA research laboratories of Dr. Fuchs, Dr. Yuan Bo Peng, and Dr. Qing Lin is partially aimed at exploring the biological mechanisms that might help explain how cognition impacts pain processes.</p>\n<p>Gatchel was recently awarded the American Psychological Foundation&#x2019;s 2017 Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Application of Psychology.

The Institute engages in planning research and practice with cities, counties and other entities to improve quality of life.</p>\n<p>The city of Dallas hopes the plan will foster inclusive and sustainable economic growth and area redevelopment through existing public and private sector efforts in Vickery Meadow.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The Vickery Meadow community of Dallas is so uniquely diverse, such a socially rich fabric to work with,&#x201D; Hamidi said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a community that dates back to the 1970s. It&#x2019;s a swath of apartments and condos that now need a rallying point, a reason to turn over and evolve into the next generation of quality development in Dallas.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The plan the institute&#x2019;s students are formulating will attempt to rebrand the area as a center for innovation, with an emphasis on countering the existing negative community perceptions of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Perception is everything in rekindling a sense of place in this community. We&#x2019;re working diligently alongside the city, community stakeholders, advocates, non-profits and residents in order to develop a plan that truly reflects their character within an effective strategy of implementation,&#x201D; said Amanda Kronk, project manager of the Institute of Urban Studies.</p>\n<p>In developing the plan, the Institute identified a number of issues to be addressed.</p>\n<p>The strategy will attempt to address the Vickery Meadow community&#x2019;s desire to improve public perception of the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>This effort will emphasize physical improvements such as pedestrian-oriented streets, as well as a branding effort that highlights the diverse, international character of the area. Future development plans will focus on coordination with public sector efforts as well as prioritizing public investment in order to achieve efficiency and have the most impact on the community.</p>\n<p>Implementation of the strategic plan began with a field study and a review of previous development plans and existing data for the neighborhood. A period of public engagement will follow, with public meetings and surveys conducted online and through the mail. Final delivery of a report package will follow in early 2017.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our graduate students in the Institute of Urban Studies, led by Dr. Hamidi, are getting real-world experience as they pursue advanced degrees in Architecture, Planning, Landscape Architecture, and Public Policy,&#x201D; CAPPA Dean Nan Ellin said. &#x201C;This in-depth proposal for Vickery Meadow will benefit the neighborhood and support the city of Dallas in its efforts to improve quality-of-life issues.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b>About CAPPA</b></p>\n<p>Established in 2015, the UTA College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs unites the former schools of Architecture and Urban and Public Affairs, offering programs in architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, planning, public administration, and public policy. The College includes the David Dillon Center for Texas Architecture, the Digital Architectural Research Consortium, the Institute of Urban Studies, the Arlington Urban Design Center based at Arlington City Hall, and the Parallel Construction design/build program.</p>\n<p><b>About The University of Texas at Arlington</b></p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington is a Carnegie Research-1 &#x201C;highest research activity&#x201D; institution.

Previous work by TRWD and UTA has resulted in development of a comprehensive, robust, nonlinear finite element model. This model was verified by soil box testing and experimental field tests conducted at the Rolling Hills Booster Pump Station in Fort Worth and by measurements of actual installations.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;What our data will show will serve as a template for future construction standards when using these kinds of large-diameter pressure pipes,&#x201D; said Abolmaali, who also is the Tseng Huang Endowed Professor in civil engineering. &#x201C;Modeling the behavior of pipes with different backfill is integral to making the infrastructure last and work to the best of its ability.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Future work, if the modeling proves successful, may lead to developing informed design equations to improve the reliability and economics of large diameter pipelines.</p>\n<p>These pressure pipes are between 60 to 108 inches in diameter. Once the water provider places them in soil or backfill material, it is difficult to move or repair them.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We have to get it right the first time,&#x201D; Abolmaali said. &#x201C;This research will help us to be right. We have to be right because this is where people get their drinking water from.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Abolmaali will use 3-D computer modeling techniques to simulate the pipes behavior observed in various types of soil. In addition, Abolmaali&#x2019;s research will use tested material properties and methods of soil compaction from field installations to simulate pipe strain due to loading coupled with the pipe trench wall, and bedding and backfilling characteristics.</p>\n<p>The Integrated Pipeline Project, a joint project developed by Dallas and TRWD, initiated this research. The IPL is a 149-mile pipeline of mostly 108-inch diameter pipes, which is now under phased construction by Dallas and TRWD from East Texas&#x2019; Lake Palestine to Tarrant County&#x2019;s Benbrook Lake.</p>\n<p>The soils in the IPL project area include shrink-swell soils which complicate pipeline design and construction. The IPL is being built in phases, allowing some parts of the IPL to be used for testing the model development of this project, creating an ideal situation for large pipe research.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>A professional advisory group of leading academics, industry, design and owner engineers will review the data the research produces. This group will collaborate to determine the best method modeling, allowing designers to be confident that the mathematical simulations will represent the actual behavior of the pipe.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Peter Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering, said Abolmaali&#x2019;s project will have a tremendous impact on the North Texas region and could impact other water providers in the future.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This research allows water providers and their contractors to build in the right way, a long-lasting, more sustainable way,&#x201D; Crouch said. &#x201C;More importantly, it ensures the flow of drinking water for millions of people.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>David Marshall, TRWD engineering and operations support director, said Abolmaali&#x2019;s project could confirm that the designs will ensure reliability while minimizing the cost for construction for the district and its users.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Having reliable water transmissions pipelines is essential to Tarrant Regional Water District&#x2019;s s business,&#x201D; Marshall said. &#x201C;Having a way to confidently simulate the pipe&#x2019;s behavior will ensure all parts of the design are correct before installation begins. Water transmission is a necessity for a growing North Texas and we need to make sure it&#x2019;s as reliable as possible.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The project directly relates to a main tenet of building sustainable urban communities, part of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/index.php\">Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

It began in his native Zimbabwe, continued first in Chicago and then in Arlington, and included frequent trips between Arlington, Chicago and Europe.</p>\n<p>Feremenga, who received a doctorate in Physics and Applied Physics in December 2016, says he found a nurturing and supportive environment at UTA while conducting doctoral research in high energy physics. His experience in data analysis helped him land a job as a data scientist at a top technology company.</p>\n<p>Born in a small town in Zimbabwe, Feremenga grew up in a large family &#x2014; he was one of nine siblings &#x2014; and became interested in physics while attending high school in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital. There he specialized in mathematics, physics and chemistry, and decided that he wanted to go to college to study physics.</p>\n<p>With options limited in his home country, Feremenga applied at universities far from home. With help from the U.S. Education Assistance Center at the American Embassy in Harare, he was accepted to the University of Chicago in 2007. Feremenga &#x2014; the first member of his family to attend college &#x2014; says that life as a college student in a country almost halfway around the world from his home definitely took some getting used to.</p>\n<p>&quot;It was a big adjustment, both culturally and climatically,&quot; he said. &quot;My first winter in Chicago was &apos;blessed&apos; with a blizzard, the intensity of which the city hadn&apos;t seen in a decade. That wasn&apos;t fun. As far as adjusting to life culturally, the university offered a lot of support to foreign students, and I relied mostly on that.&quot;</p>\n<p>While he was an undergraduate, Feremenga was introduced to experimental high-energy particle physics, which he enthusiastically pursued. His faculty advisor at the University of Chicago, Young-Kee Kim, professor and chair of the Department of Physics, was at the time serving as deputy director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory or Fermilab, which specializes in high-energy particle physics. With her help, Feremenga began doing research at Fermilab.</p>\n<p>In 2010 Feremenga got the opportunity to return to Africa when he was selected to be a member of the inaugural class of the African School of Fundamental Physics and Applications at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, near Cape Town. The three-week intensive program, now held biannually, targets students in sub-Saharan Africa and is aimed at increasing capacity development in fundamental physics and related applications in Africa.</p>\n<p>Feremenga knew he wanted to pursue graduate studies in physics but wasn&apos;t sure where he wanted to go. Kim suggested he talk to Jaehoon Yu, a professor of physics at UTA and a friend of hers. While at a conference in Chicago, Yu met with Feremenga and helped him arrange a visit to UTA.</p>\n<p>When he visited the campus, Feremenga liked what he saw and was particularly excited by the fact that UTA physicists were playing a significant role with the Large Hadron Collider or LHC, the world&apos;s largest and most powerful particle collider, located at the CERN laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland.</p>\n<p>&quot;I thought Dr. Yu&apos;s research was very interesting, and it helped that he and Dr. Kim knew each other,&quot; he said. &quot;My transition from undergrad to grad school was very seamless.&quot;</p>\n<p>After receiving his bachelor&#x2019;s degree in Physics from the University of Chicago in 2011, Feremenga headed south to Arlington. With Yu as his supervising professor, he began research on his dissertation project, which involved analyzing massive quantities of data from the ATLAS experiment. ATLAS is one of two general purpose detectors at the LHC; portions of it were constructed at UTA and shipped overseas to CERN.</p>\n<p>In addition to UTA, Feremenga spent time at both CERN and the Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago, analyzing hundreds of terabytes of data from the ATLAS experiment.</p>\n<p>&quot;At CERN and Argonne, I assisted in developing a system that filters interesting events from large datasets,&quot; he said. &quot;I also analyzed these large datasets to find interesting physics patterns.&quot;</p>\n<p>In July 2012, scientists at CERN announced the discovery of the elusive Higgs boson, an elementary particle first theorized in the 1960s but never positively identified until experiments at the LHC. Feremenga relished the opportunity to work with brilliant physicists from around the globe.</p>\n<p>&quot;It was challenging yet satisfying,&quot; he said. &quot;I worked side-by-side with scientists from diverse backgrounds and nationalities. I also had the rare opportunity to travel around every summer. Nothing could have beaten that.&quot;</p>\n<p>Feremenga says Yu and other members of UTA&apos;s physics faculty, including Andrew Brandt, Kaushik De and Haleh Hadavand, were very supportive of him and his research during his doctoral studies.</p>\n<p>&quot;I found the environment here at UTA to be very nurturing,&quot; Feremenga said. &quot;I grew a lot in my years here. And the Office of International Education worked with me hand-in-hand whenever I traveled. The people were fantastic and my experience here was everything I could have hoped for.&quot;</p>\n<p>Yu says Feremenga&apos;s success stems largely from his own drive and determination.</p>\n<p>&quot;He was a very mature student from the start,&quot; Yu said. &quot;He was thoughtful and a good scientist. He was a hard worker and put in great time and effort to accomplish his physics goals. I think he will be very successful no matter where he goes.&quot;</p>\n<p>Feremenga, who recently got married and moved to Nashville, Tennessee to start his new job, says he hopes to see more young people in his home country of Zimbabwe and other parts of Africa receive the same opportunities in STEM education that he was provided.</p>\n<p>&quot;I would like to encourage young kids, especially from the most impoverished parts of Zimbabwe and Africa, to pursue studies in physics,&quot; he said. &quot;Very accomplished physicists &#x2014; case in point, our own Jae Yu &#x2014; are reaching out in an effort to engage talent that would have otherwise been lost. To them I&apos;d say, take advantage of that. Trust me, the rewards are vast!&quot;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

O&apos;Connell&apos;s faculty advisor is Matt Fujita, assistant professor of biology.</p>\n<p>&quot;I was incredibly excited because I had been turned down by NSF several times already and this was my last chance to receive the award,&quot; O&#x2019;Connell said. &quot;Plus, receiving a doctoral dissertation award is a huge step toward advancing in the evolutionary biology field, so it was very important to me.&quot;</p>\n<p>The award, which is for $19,695, will support O&apos;Connell&apos;s dissertation research, which focuses primarily on the promoters of speciation - the formation of new and distinct species in the course of evolution - on the Indonesian island of Sumatra using parachuting frogs of the genus Rhacophorus.</p>\n<p>&quot;I use genetic data to build phylogenetic trees that allow me to test hypotheses about what processes have been responsible for producing the extensive diversity that we see on Sumatra,&quot; O&apos;Connell said.</p>\n<p>The project also includes working on descriptions of some of the new species that O&apos;Connell and others discovered during recent field work in Sumatra and the neighboring island of Java with Eric Smith, associate professor of biology, and members of Smith&apos;s lab.</p>\n<p>&quot;What is exciting is that we are using integrative methods that use genetic and genomic data, as well as internal osteological (the branch of anatomy dealing with the skeleton) data generated from CT scanning done here at UTA,&quot; O&apos;Connell said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, O&apos;Connell&apos;s research has included investigation of the processes underpinning diversification of North American snakes.</p>\n<p>&quot;This project is neat because different species exhibit genetic discontinuities, or population structure, at congruent geographical features, such as the Mississippi River or the Continental Divide,&quot; he said. &quot;This indicates that these features have been important for diversification of a broad range of species in North America.&quot;</p>\n<p>Fujita said that O&apos;Connell&apos;s project takes advantage of the unique geological history of the region to address fundamental questions in biogeography.</p>\n<p>&quot;His project will also leverage the latest in sequencing technologies to answer his research questions,&quot; Fujita said. &quot;The integration of all of these factors - a unique system, big questions in evolutionary biology, and the latest in sequencing and analytical tools - was deservedly recognized by National Science Foundation as an important endeavor.&quot;</p>\n<p><b>Kyle O&apos;Connell is using CT scans of parachuting frogs in his doctoral research.</b></p>\n<p>O&apos;Connell received a B.S. in Fisheries and Wildlife and a B.A. in Spanish from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 2011 before coming to UTA to begin his doctoral work. As a child he loved watching The Crocodile Hunter, the TV show hosted by Steve Irwin, the late Australian nature expert who became famous for wrestling crocodiles. Following high school, he worked as a summer zookeeper as part of the reptile crew at the Omaha Zoo.</p>\n<p>While at the University of Nebraska, O&apos;Connell chose to major in Fisheries and Wildlife in the School of Natural Resources because it involved plenty of hands-on time in the field and allowed him to pursue research with reptiles and amphibians. When it came time to decide what the focus of his doctoral studies would be, reptiles and amphibians was the clear choice.</p>\n<p>&quot;Plus, I figured this would be the best way to get to wrestle crocs like Steve Irwin,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead, now I study tree frogs!&quot;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Dasgupta is the fourth American academic to win the award and the first of Indian origin. A special issue of <i>Talanta,</i> an acclaimed international journal devoted to Analytical Chemistry, will be published to coincide with the award ceremony, to commemorate this occasion.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a tremendous honor and I&#x2019;m very grateful for this recognition by my peers,&#x201D; Dasgupta said. &#x201C;By recognizing me, they are also honoring several generations of my students from all over the world, who are so involved and committed to my work and form a cornerstone of my success.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dasgupta has won numerous awards over the course of his career. In 2016, he was awarded the Eastern Analytical Symposium&#x2019;s highest award, the Award for Outstanding Achievements in the Fields of Analytical Chemistry, and the Tech Titans Technology Inventors Award for his many innovations in chemical and environmental analysis.</p>\n<p>Other honors include the 2015 American Chemical Society Division of Analytical Chemistry J. Calvin Giddings Award for Excellence in Education; the 2012 Stephen Dal Nogare Award in Chromatography; the 2012 Wilfred T. Doherty Award, DFW Section of the ACS; and the 2011 ACS Award in Chromatography. He also was named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and an honorary member of the Japan Society of Analytical Chemistry, both in 2015.</p>\n<p>Dasgupta&#x2019;s high-impact research is improving public health on a global scale, a clear demonstration of advancing the University&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020:&#xA0; Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</p>\n<p>Among his recent research projects, Dasgupta led a team which devised a new method to measure the amount of blood present in dry blood spot analysis, providing an alternative to the current preferred approach of measuring sodium levels. Dry blood spot analysis is simple, inexpensive, and is routinely used to screen newborns for metabolic disorders. It also has proven effective in diagnosing HIV infection in infants, especially in developing countries where health budgets are limited.</p>\n<p>Another of Dasgupta&#x2019;s recent projects is the development of a prototype for an implantable in-line shunt flow monitoring system for hydrocephalus patients, which could lead to better treatment, especially in infants and children who account for a large percentage of shunt operations every year.</p>\n<p>In another project, Dasgupta is using a $1.2 million grant from NASA to further the search for amino acids, the so-called building blocks of life, by extending a platform he developed to detect and separate ions.</p>\n<p>Dasgupta&#x2019;s active research areas also include methods for environmentally friendly analysis of arsenic in drinking water; rapid analysis of trace heavy metals in the atmosphere; iodine nutrition in women and infants and the role of the chemical perchlorate; and the development of a NASA-funded ion chromatograph for testing extraterrestrial soil, such as that found on Mars.</p>\n<p>Dasgupta received a bachelor&#x2019;s degree with honors in Chemistry from Bankura Christian College in 1968 and a master&#x2019;s degree in inorganic chemistry from the University of Burdwan in 1970, both located in West Bengal, India. He came to the United States in 1973 and earned his doctorate in analytical chemistry under Philip W. West, with a minor in electrical engineering, from Louisiana State University in 1977. &#xA0;He has published more than 400 papers and holds 29 patents.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Patel of Stanford University, found that a significant number of caregivers have a limited understanding of concussions and their impact on a child&#x2019;s future.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;They did understand that it&#x2019;s a severe injury but they didn&#x2019;t understand how susceptible patients are,&#x201D; said Trowbridge, a noted expert on concussions in middle and high school athletes. &#x201C;We found out that despite the fact that all parents had read some brochure or seen some TV show about concussions they had a low self efficacy about awareness. They tended not to know that concussions are associated with all sports, including track and field, volleyball and swimming.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Sports related concussions account for 53 percent of all head injuries in young people under the age of 19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. The CDC estimates that there are between 1.6 and 3.8 million sports related injuries among young people each year.</p>\n<p>Concussions have received heightened attention in recent years because of the large number of retired professional football players who have sued the National Football League. These retired players claim that in some instances they were sent back into games despite the fact that their coaches knew there was a reasonable chance they may have suffered concussions on the gridiron.</p>\n<p>In each of the 50 states there are laws requiring teams to take out athletes who may have suffered concussions. The decision is often made by members of the concussion care team, a group of objective health care professionals that includes a physician, an advanced practice nurse and an athletic trainer.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We live in an age in which parents recognize more than ever the importance of athletics in instilling skills like discipline, concentration, team work and leadership in young people,&#x201D; said Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation. &#x201C;But we need to be just as mindful about the kinds of dangerous, unseen injuries that come from playing sports. This study is a useful tool for building awareness and arming parents with some really good information.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Trowbridge said they were motivated to do the study to find out what caregivers understand about concussions and how to better educate them so they can be more effective in looking for symptoms or other possible signs of trouble.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s important to involve not only the athletes but the caregivers,&#x201D; said Trowbridge. &#x201C;It is the caregiver that knows the child the best and can often recognize the signs and symptoms.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>She added that studies show many young athletes do not always tell the truth about their symptoms because they want to continue playing.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are still learning how concussion symptoms resolve but we know that they don&#x2019;t get better by sending someone right back in with symptoms,&#x201D; Trowbridge said. &#x201C;Sports is so magical and so many things can be learned from sports, but we have to give the caregivers the tools to be able to protect the youth athlete when they can&#x2019;t protect themselves.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Trowbridge said caregivers should be discriminating when picking physicians to examine their children for possible concussions, adding that not all physicians understand concussions. She encourages them to consult with neurologists, primary care physicians who specialize in sports medicine and concussion specialists when seeking medical advice.</p>\n"

He will provide leadership and coordination for all veterans programs on campus and serve as a resource for student veterans, faculty and staff.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/james-kumm-veteran-affairs-director.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>James Kumm is UTA&apos;s new Executive Director for Veterans Programs.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>UTA is ranked No. 1 in Texas and No. 20 in the nation as &#x201C;Best for Vets&#x201D; by Military Times magazine, a premier publication to the U.S. veteran community. The university served a veteran-related population of approximately 3,500 in academic year 2015-16, attracted in part to the university&#x2019;s academic excellence, strong commitment to student success, dynamic approach to supporting our veteran community, and the institution&#x2019;s ranking of having the second lowest average student debt upon graduation in the nation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The nation and this university owe our veterans a tremendous debt of gratitude for their service, and we are privileged to be able to provide them degrees and skill sets that will equip them to re-enter the workforce and further enrich society as talented professionals in their fields,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;James Kumm will be instrumental in continuing the excellence of our programs to ensure the success of this valued student group. I am very proud of the commitment our current faculty and staff have made in developing our programs to be #1 in the State of Texas. Adding James to this great team will help create a more centralized and comprehensive approach that will benefit our entire community.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The selection process was guided by retired Army Gen. Ben Griffin, Special Advisor to the President in matters related to veteran success. In designing the new position, the university focused on best practices from other institutions in addition to UTA&#x2019;s success in serving veterans.&#xA0; The recruiting process fielded interest from around the country from a highly qualified pool of candidates.</p>\n<p>UTA has many excellent programs that serve veterans, including the Veterans Business Outreach Center (VBOC) - one of only 19 at universities nationwide, and the Veterans Upward Bound Program - one of only 49 at universities around the nation. UTA&#x2019;s veteran orientation specifically addresses the unique needs of veterans returning to their educational pursuits either during or at the conclusion of military service. &#xA0;The state-of-the-art Lockheed Martin Career Development Center offers veteran-specific training and support to ensure that military service, skills, and experience translate to civilian employment, and also connects students to veteran-friendly employers to enhance career prospects and networking.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Veterans bring unique experiences to a college campus and contribute immensely to the diversity for which UTA is known,&#x201D; said Kumm. &#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s established track record of serving this very important constituency and its demonstrated commitment to building on that strong record are what attracted me to this position, and I look forward to enhancing the services to veteran students.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mr. Kumm joins UTA on May 22, 2017. He is currently Director of Admissions and Academic Advising at Dodge City Community College (DCCC) in Kansas, where he was a founding member of the Veterans Advisory Board and a vocal and engaged advocate for veteran support.

ASHRAE also provided us with owners&#x2019; requirements for the project such as building size, room types, desired interior conditions, and budget. These requirements aided us in selecting HVAC equipment that would be suitable for that building and the specific climate.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>For Guerra, he believes the senior design project and subsequent Rising Star award helped him obtain the Purdy McGuire position.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;What we learned in senior design helps in the professional world.

AWM is one of the leading organizations in the United States dedicated to promoting equal opportunity for women and girls in math. Senior math major Christin Milman traveled to Chicago to accept the award, bestowed for an innovative funding model developed by the chapter&#x2019;s approximately 50 members.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I think it is important for a university like UTA to encourage girls and women to pursue mathematics because universities often provide the impetus for social change,&#x201D; said Elizabeth Stephenson, a UTA senior and past president of the AWM student chapter. &#x201C;Historically, females have been discouraged from entering STEM fields, and in the interest of building a strong, innovative scientific community founded on interdisciplinary collaborative learning, it is necessary to provide equal opportunities for all individuals.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Stephenson came to UTA as a freshman with her eyes set on a career in engineering. She says she &#x201C;fearfully&#x201D; took a calculus class, but the class was so well-taught that she found her true passion and changed her major to math.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The student chapter received the AWM award because of the unique way members raise money and help fellow students. Working with other student groups, the AWM hosts comprehensive review sessions before departmental exams. AWM charges a small fee per student for every review. Undergraduate AWM members lead the sessions. As a result, test takers are well-prepared and session leaders gain confidence and develop critical public speaking skills.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our student leaders in the UTA AWM student chapter have taken great ownership of their organization, creating and advancing a positive, supportive environment for women in math,&#x201D;&#xA0;said Theresa Jorgensen, an associate professor of mathematics at UTA, undergraduate advisor, and faculty sponsor of the AWM student chapter. &#x201C;I was proud to nominate them and boast of their outstanding achievements.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Through its focused and sustained efforts to recruit women and traditionally underrepresented minority groups as faculty members and students, the UTA Department of Mathematics is reshaping a frequent misconception that math and other STEM pursuits are male-oriented fields. The department has received multiple accolades for its innovation and excellence.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The culture of the math department at UTA is a microcosm of the Maverick culture across the University,&#x201D; Jorgensen said. &#x201C;We have a critical mass of women in math, both at the student level as well as at the faculty level.&#xA0;The result is that the females in our department stand out for the mathematics they do, as it should be, not for being a female. This makes recruiting women and setting them up for success a natural part of our department&#x2019;s ethos.&#xA0;In fact, this positive and supportive environment benefits all of our students, not just the women.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Jorgensen is a 2010 winner of The University of Texas System&#x2019;s Regents Outstanding Teaching Award, a prestigious recognition reserved only for educators who exemplify the highest caliber of excellence working with undergraduate students. Two of her mathematics colleagues are also Regents Outstanding Teaching Award recipients: Associate Professor and Distinguished Teaching Professor Barbara Shipman in 2010 and Professor Minerva Cordero in 2009. Cordero was named a 2016 Ford &#x201C;Legendary Woman&#x201D; by the Ford Motor Corporation and she is the recipient of a Great Minds in STEM&#x2122; &#x201C;Education Distinction&#x201D; Award.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Since 2006, four multi-year grants from the U.S. Department of Education&#x2019;s Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need, or GAANN, program funded UTA&#x2019;s efforts to attract women and minorities to graduate programs in math and also support them with financial assistance and mentoring as they earn doctoral degrees. The department received the prestigious Exemplary Program or Achievement by a Mathematics Department Award from the American Mathematical Society in 2013. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Education used the department as an example of one of the most successful GAANN programs in the nation in its published fact sheet for student services. In late July, Associate Professor and Graduate Advisor James &#xC1;lvarez received the Meritorious Service Award from the Mathematical Association of America.</p>\n<p>The success enjoyed by the UTA Department of Mathematics is indicative of substantial campuswide progress along the University&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020 <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/index.php\">Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, which set forth a path for excellence in research, teaching and community engagement in four broad themes. A recent Department of Mathematics <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/03/Math-release-imaging.php\">project</a> funded by a National Science Foundation grant is supporting early graduate students, especially women and underrepresented minority students, as they conduct research in the themes of <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">Health and the Human Condition</a> and <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">Data-Driven Discovery</a>.

The system then delivers the matches instantly to readers and viewers.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Chengkai Li\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/chengkai-li.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Chengkai Li, UTA associate professor of computer science and engineering, will lead a team that will improve an automated fact-checking system called ClaimBuster.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>ClaimBuster was used successfully during many of the 2016 presidential debates and 2017 Australian Parliament discussions on national topics.</p>\n<p>Li plans to further develop the tool to automatically check various types of new claims that have not been checked before against knowledge databases and report if they are truthful. For novel claims where humans must be brought into the loop, the system will provide tools to assist professionals and laypersons in understanding and vetting those claims.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Currently, ClaimBuster pays a lot of attention to one particular step in the process of fact-checking &#x2014; identifying factual claims that are worth checking,&#x201D; Li said. &#x201C;With the new grant, we will expand our effort to many components in the end-to-end system and they will work in tandem.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;ClaimBuster has proved to be an effective tool in combatting fake news. If we are successful with this next step, the expanded tool could have a large impact on many areas of society beyond print, broadcast and social media.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption150\"><img alt=\"Mark Tremayne\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/mark-tremayne.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Mark Tremayne, UTA assistant professor of communication, is part of the ClaimBuster team.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Tremayne, who researches online journalism and the industry&#x2019;s continuing transformation, said one aspect that makes the research challenging is that the volume of news has increased considerably, making automation of some aspects of fact-checking desirable.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;With thousands of sources of information offering their own versions of the truth, using computational journalism techniques to help readers sort through it makes sense,&#x201D; Tremayne said. &#x201C;Also, putting claims in context can help people understand the broader picture, even if a statement is partly true.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The team will model factual claims and produce internal representations, then create taxonomies of claim templates in different domains. Next, the team will devise novel methods for translating claims into structured queries, keyword queries and natural language questions which will be compared with the answers embedded in the claims themselves, to verify if the claims check out. Finally, they will develop methods to find counter-arguments to claims and interesting &#x201C;factlets&#x201D; from datasets that will allow them to identify &#x201C;cherry-picking&#x201D; claims that are correct but misleading.</p>\n<p>For example, The Weather Channel criticized Breitbart in December 2016 for cherry-picking data after Breitbart claimed that, &#x201C;global land temperatures have plummeted by one degree Celsius since the middle of this year &#x2013; the biggest and steepest fall on record.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The Weather Channel said the truth is that &#x201C;this number comes from one satellite-based estimate of temperatures above land areas in the lower atmosphere. Data from the other two groups that regularly publish satellite-based temperature estimates show smaller drops, more typical of the decline one would expect after a strong El Ni&#xF1;o event. Temperatures over land give an incomplete picture of global-scale temperature. Most of the planet &#x2013; about 70 percent &#x2013; is covered by water, and the land surface warms and cools more quickly than the ocean. Land-plus-ocean data from the other two satellite groups, released after the Breitbart article, show that Earth&#x2019;s lower atmosphere actually set a record high in November 2016.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Li hopes to expand ClaimBuster&#x2019;s use to verify information in narratives, discourses and documents such as sports news, legal documents and financial reports. It has a large base of potential users including consumers, publishers, corporate competitors and legal professionals, among others. It could directly benefit consumers by improving information accuracy and transparency.</p>\n<p>ClaimBuster also will help news organizations accelerate their fact-checking process and ensure the accuracy of their own news stories. Businesses could use it to identify inaccuracies in their competitors&#x2019; and their own reports and press releases. It also could assist professionals such as lawyers in verifying documents.</p>\n<p>Li, Tremayne and Christoph Csallner, associate professor of computer science and engineering, also are building computer tools to detect social bots within the worldwide web that create and spread fake news through a project funded through the Texas National Security Network Excellence Fund out of the University of Texas at Austin&#x2019;s Clements Center for National Security and The Robert S. Strauss Center for International Security and Law.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;People have more sources for news and information than ever before, and the proliferation of fake news in recent years makes it difficult to sort through what is real and what isn&#x2019;t. Dr. Li and his collaborators have made great strides in helping people verify what they hear or read in the media, and the expansion of this service to business and professional interests is an important next step,&#x201D; said Peter Crouch, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>This project embodies the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a> platform under <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>\n"

We believe the findings can also suggest effective intervention and prevention programs to help transfer students avoid taking missteps and wrong turns as they progress to obtaining baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields of study.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The research is tightly aligned with the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board&#x2019;s ambitious 60x30TX plan, which aims to prepare 60 percent of its 25- to 34-year-old workforce to have postsecondary credentials. It also supports UTA&#x2019;s initiatives to build a supportive environment where all students can flourish as scholars and citizens.</p>\n<p>Zhang said past research has been limited to understanding factors that hinder or support students&#x2019; STEM choice, performance, persistence and timely degree completion in four-year universities. However, much of the past research focused on students&#x2019; socio-demographic variables and how these variables predict students&#x2019; desired outcomes of college.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These studies only enable researchers to identify which gender group, social class or race and ethnicity has a higher likelihood of outperforming the others in STEM education, but fail to address what underlying factors contribute to such a phenomenon,&#x201D; Zhang said. &#x201C;These studies lead to minimal implications for higher education institutions, which seek to cultivate a successful STEM environment on campus, particularly for a growing body of transfer students.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>She said rather than analyzing which socio-demographic group is more likely to pursue STEM studies or graduate with a STEM degree, there is a need to identify underlying factors that contribute to the desired outcomes in STEM education, which is the major contribution of the proposed study.</p>\n<p>The award helps further UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">Strategic Plan&#xA0;<i>Bold Solutions | Global Impact</i></a>, especially in the areas of <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a> and improving <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This research will identify the challenges experienced by many community college transfer students who are focusing on STEM fields,&#x201D; said Teresa Taber Doughty, UTA College of Education dean and professor. &#x201C;We anticipate that the findings will directly inform our ability to decrease degree challenges while increasing college degree completion rates for these students.

Researchers intend to fill a profitable niche in the energy field by converting natural gas to high-grade diesel and jet fuel.</p>\n<p>Fort Worth-based Greenway Innovative Energy gave The University of Texas at Arlington $750,000 last year to build the lab. The official ribbon-cutting ceremony this week unveiled years of innovation that will help fuel the world.</p>\n<p>Fred MacDonnell, professor and chair in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Brian Dennis, professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, have perfected a conversion process and created a proprietary technology that allows them to produce liquid fuel on a larger scale, a scale that eventually will move the lab on the road to where natural gas is available.</p>\n<p>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said this partnership signals a critical turning point for the University, Greenway and the world.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;For all of us situated in the metroplex, this is something very important. We are growing at a tremendous pace in this metroplex.&#xA0;We will become a megacity in the next 10 years, and that means there is going to be even more demand on natural resources, and more demand to have cleaner fuels, more efficient fuels and cheaper sources of energy,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s what this project is all about &#x2013; trying to take a plentiful natural resource, and convert it in a very efficient and clean way into something you and I will use every day. That is a tremendous impact, not just on this University, not just on the metroplex, but across our nation.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption450\"><img alt=\"Conrad Greer Lab ribbon cutting\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/greer-lab-ribboncutting.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Officials cut the ribbon at a ceremony marking the opening of the Conrad Greer Lab.

Many times, those areas remain untapped.</p>\n<p>Wright said F. Conrad Greer was the initial catalyst for the idea.</p>\n<p>Greer, Greenway&#x2019;s former chief executive officer, died earlier this year. He was an internationally recognized petroleum engineer and chemist who is known for his extensive work in the evaluation of oil and gas properties, reservoir engineering and the development of enhanced oil recovery methods.</p>\n<p>Wright said Greer was passionate about innovation in the development of alternative fuels and came up with the concept for Greenway as he watched natural gas exploration and production soar in the United States over the past two decades.</p>\n<p>Pat Six, executive vice president for Greenway, told audience members that they were going to witness &#x201C;disruptive technology.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This has the potential to be a world changer,&#x201D; Six said. &#x201C;We have the potential for Texas to lead the world in the most economic way of producing diesel and jet fuel.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Karbhari, Wright and Six all praised the UTA team that produced and perfected the technology, too.</p>\n<p>Dennis said interdisciplinary work between engineering and chemistry was essential to the success of the project. That interdisciplinary endeavor allows researchers to work across traditional boundaries for the good of the project and eventually the world.</p>\n<p>MacDonnell said he has many friends at many research institutions across the country.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The ability of researchers to work together here, just their willingness to work together is unprecedented,&#x201D; MacDonnell said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never been on such a collegial campus.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Greenway officials are anticipating deployment of a field unit that converts natural gas to liquid within the next 24 months.</p>\n<p>They said the potential for the technology is especially important for countries that have less oil reserves but have plenty of natural gas. The size of the gas-to-liquid operating system also can be significantly smaller in scale than a refinery.</p>\n<p>Greenway recognizes that such technology could be affordable for many developing countries that produce crude oil and flare vast quantities of the natural gas co-produced with the oil. The GTL technology would allow them to directly produce diesel fuel from this &#x2018;waste product.&#x2019;</p>\n<p>A typical plant would consist of two major operations, conversion of natural gas to syngas and a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis operation which converts syngas to equal parts fuel and water.&#xA0; The water is 98 percent pure, metal-free, and after removal of some alcohols, is potable. This could be critical to countries that lack sufficient access to water.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Public Water Solutions, a Texas-based utility resource provider, coordinated the examination of Ennis&#x2019; critical underground assets. The results will provide community leaders the ability to prioritize millions of dollars of future infrastructure spending.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Ennis City Manager R. Scott Dixon says his community is facing a tremendous backlog of sewer line improvements totaling tens of millions of dollars and resources for expensive replacements are limited. Like other public utilities, increased spending by Ennis would result in increases in water and sewer rates. Arlington&#x2019;s team is now preparing a full assessment on a section of sewer main that carries most of Ennis&#x2019; sanitary sewer flow.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is our hope that the outcome of this project will help the city to minimize the amount of investment required to prevent a major failure on one of its primary sanitary sewer lines,&#x201D; Dixon says. &#x201C;If we are able to reduce the number of linear feet of the line that has to be replaced and identify areas where failure is imminent, we can better allocate our funding and address other equally high priority lines elsewhere in the system.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Since October 2016, Arlington has been using the MSI HD Profiler, a multi-sensor robot that gathers information using a high definition camera, lasers and sonar, to examine large diameter sanitary sewer mains 24 to 72 inches in diameter under an exclusive agreement with the equipment supplier.</p>\n<p>The program is a partnership with the UTA Department of Civil Engineering. Data from the MSI HD Profiler and another smaller robot helps UTA and Arlington Water pinpoint areas for further structural evaluation, repair or possible replacement. More than 150,000 feet of Arlington sanitary sewer main have been inspected since the inspection program began.</p>\n<p>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said the Ennis project &#x2013; more than 50 miles away &#x2013; signals the beginning for this technology and others being developed at the University.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The maintenance of sewer lines can cost cities millions of dollars in taxpayer funds,&#x201D; said Dr. Karbhari. &#x201C;This technology is an example of how our faculty demands excellence and research that can be impactful to the communities we serve and those around the world.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Ali Abolmaali, chair of the UTA Department of Civil Engineering said he believes this kind of technology could be used nationwide.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA and Arlington Water were able to cut the costs of the evaluations for Arlington residents and now Ennis residents by establishing this unique partnership to use the MSI HD Profiler and performing the work with in-house crews,&#x201D; said Abolmaali, who also is the Dr. Tseng Huang Endowed Professor in civil engineering. &#x201C;The project has already gained national attention &#x2013; with the American Society of Civil Engineers naming the project a &#x2018;Game Changer&#x2019; in the area of public infrastructure in 2016.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Arlington Mayor Jeff Williams recognized how the technology has benefited Arlington and its residents.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The partnership with The University of Texas at Arlington has created many valuable opportunities over the years that have benefitted our residents and business community,&#x201D; Mayor Williams said. &#x201C;The sanitary sewer inspections and infrastructure research being done with these multi-sensor robots are just the latest examples of how Arlington and UTA are tapping innovative technology to make a real difference.&#x201D;</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><i>-- The City of Arlington contributed to this article.</i></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Control electronics and packaging necessary to operate the laser could increase its size to that of a computer, considerably smaller than current laser operation packages.</p>\n<p>Some promising applications for these lasers would be precision laser-cutting and 3-D machining that could be performed on a tabletop machine instead of a machine that takes up much of a room and LiDAR sensing for autonomous vehicles. LiDAR is Light, Detection and Ranging and gives autonomous vehicles awareness of their surroundings. Smaller platforms also would be much more cost-effective.</p>\n<p>Zhou is a Fellow of the International Society for Optical Engineering. He has more than 300 journal publications and conference presentations. He joined UTA in 2004 after a brief career in industry. He has been the primary investigator on research grants totaling nearly $8 million and has been involved with more than 40 projects totaling more than $20 million since 2004.</p>\n<p>The Electrical Engineering Department is an integral component of UTA&#x2019;s College of Engineering, which is the third-largest in Texas with an enrollment of more than 7,200.</p>\n<p>Peter Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering, commended Zhou&#x2019;s innovations as a model of the University&#x2019;s work to advance <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/impact.php\">Global Environmental Impact</a> under the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Zhou has long been a leader in nanotechnology and optics, and this new grant could change how lasers are used,&#x201D; Crouch said. &#x201C;If lasers are smaller, lighter and less costly, they can be applied to many more platforms, with possibilities for their use that have not been considered previously.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Several other UTA electrical engineers are conducting research in optics, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professor Robert Magnusson is a charter Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors and a Life Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

        "body": "\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption666\"><img alt=\"Entrepreneurship Ecosystem\" id=\"story-image-1\" src=\"/news/images/entreprenuership-presss-release-graphic-v4.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p class=\"p2\">2016 Tech Titans Inventors awardee and University of Texas at Arlington chemistry Professor Purnendu &#x201C;Sandy&#x201D; Dasgupta has been described as a &#x201C;patent-making machine.&#x201D; But he is more than that.&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Three of his inventions are an integral part of chromatograph machines, which are widely used to analyze the content of complex mixtures in fields as varied as forensic testing, doping analysis, pharmaceutical development and even nuclear power. Annual sales of these machines surpass $2 billion worldwide.&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">&#x201C;We have developed a very long-term relationship with multinational ThermoFisher Scientific to support taking our discoveries right through to the commercialization phase where they can benefit society,&#x201D; Dr. Dasgupta said. &#x201C;They give us continuous financial support, alongside equipment and supplies, and work with us to make these dreams a reality. More than 15 of my inventions are licensed to ThermoFisher Scientific, which also benefits the University financially every year.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My students also benefit,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;ThermoFisher Scientific has hired and given internships to several of my students, giving them the opportunity to gain experience all across the invention timeline, from discovery to commercialization.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Dasgupta is not alone in this success. UTA has developed a strong innovation pipeline, with more than 100 patents issued over the last five years and more than 25 technologies licensed to outside companies. Some 60 faculty and students are currently working on start-ups and more than 20 start-up companies are developing around UTA.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is committed to developing an environment and culture that eliminates obstacles to innovation and entrepreneurship so that results of research and creative activity can be moved from our studios and laboratories into the economy for the benefit of society,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp Karbhari.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are actively working with faculty, students, and our own alumni, as well as the community, the city, the chamber of commerce, business accelerators, and potential investors, to build an entrepreneurship culture with the necessary support systems to ensure inventors can really succeed,&#x201D; he continued.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><b>CULTURE OF INVENTION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p>UTA has developed a culture that embraces both faculty and student entrepreneurship as elements that coexist and reinforce each other.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Many of UTA&#x2019;s faculty members have a strong record of success as inventors, so they can pass their experience on to student entrepreneurs looking to take their ideas into the marketplace.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We now count 12 faculty and top administrators who have been named fellows of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI), an organization that specifically recognizes their capacity to translate inventions into tangible benefits for society,&#x201D; said Duane Dimos, UTA vice president for research.&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#x201C;Their inventiveness and that of the faculty and students they attract to the University has become&#xA0;the basis for a wider University entrepreneurship culture that permeates our Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;Leading in creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship is one of our guiding aspirations.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>One of those NAI fellows is Robert Magnusson, UTA&#x2019;s Texas Instruments Distinguished University Chair in Nanoelectronics and professor of electrical engineering, who broke his own record in 2015 with five patents issued in less than a year and who now holds a total of 20 issued patents, with 13 more pending. He has also successfully translated these inventions into a start-up company, Resonant Sensors, that is having commercial success.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My idea with my lab is that you can walk in with an idea and walk out with a device,&#x201D; Dr. Magnusson said. &#x201C;It is always a cause for celebration when a patent is issued and getting five in short order never happened to me before.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Another prolific inventor is J.-C. Chiao, UTA&#x2019;s Janet and Mike Greene Endowed Professor and Jenkins Garrett Endowed Professor of Electrical Engineering, who was recently named a fellow of SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics, in recognition for his achievements in micro medical devices and systems. Dr. Chiao already has 12 issued patents and is another prior Tech Titans Inventors awardee.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This strong culture of innovation is also attracting faculty members who have already been successful in the corporate world. Krish Prabhu, former chief technology officer of AT&amp;T, has taken the post of research professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. Dr. Prabhu oversaw the company&#x2019;s global technology direction, which includes network innovation, product development and research, intellectual property organization and global supply chain organization.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Other inventors with successful previous careers in business include J.-C. Chaio, who worked for Bell Communications and Chorum Technologies; business professor Kay-Yut Chen, who worked as a principal research scientist at Yahoo Labs; and physics professor Wei Chen, a former senior scientist for Nomadics Inc. who recently developed&#xA0;the advanced grow technology behind the start-up SolGro.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA also actively promotes increased innovation among faculty through UTA&#x2019;s Interdisciplinary Research Program, which provides seed grants for interdisciplinary proposals on a competitive basis. Nine teams have been funded and to date one has presented a patent disclosure for &#x201C;<i>A System for Neuro Feedback Anger Management to Prevent Domestic Violence</i>,&#x201D; a systematic method and technology to help individuals control anger responses.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;By taking advantage of the multiple perspectives offered by interdisciplinary research, these teams have proposed new ways of attacking real-world problems, demonstrating yet again the commitment of our faculty to the highest level of scholarship,&#x201D; Dr. Dimos said.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption666\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/fab-lab-21mar2017-006.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>FabLab at the UTA Library</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p><b>ENTREPRENEURSHIP ECOSYSTEM&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p>UTA has developed an elaborate entrepreneurship ecosystem to support faculty, students, alumni and community inventors. Specialized curricula, spaces to encourage innovation and interaction among entrepreneurs, support for events and pitch competitions and a very proactive patenting and licensing office with strong links to business accelerators and the investor community all reinforce the ecosystem and contribute to inventors&#x2019; success. UTA&#x2019;s support also extends to prototyping, development and business consulting for start-ups.</p>\n<p><b>Curricula</b></p>\n<p>UTA has designed curricula addressing creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship that is oriented toward students of all disciplines. The College of Business offers certificates in entrepreneurship that provide any interested student with skills and training in identifying innovations and market opportunities, writing a business plan, obtaining funding and launching a new company&#x2014;in other words, the basic tools needed to become entrepreneurs.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Courses within the certificate, which can be earned as part of degree programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels, include Entrepreneurship and Venture Management, Entrepreneurship in the Arts, Engineering Entrepreneurship, Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation and Creativity and Entrepreneurship.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Capstone senior design projects are required for all engineering undergraduates prior to graduation. Each project team, made up of five to six senior undergraduate students, is required to take on a real-world engineering problem, often sponsored by a local company looking for expert help. The teams are expected to design, implement, test and provide a final demonstration of a prototype solution, all over a two-semester period.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Chris McMurrough, senior lecturer for the Computer Science and Engineering Department&#x2019;s (CSE) senior design courses, is a UTA alumnus who teaches by day and runs a robotics start-up at night.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>He helped organize the senior design showcase and encourages the students to become entrepreneurs.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There are 17 CSE teams presenting projects this semester, which is a record,&#x201D; Dr. McMurrough said. &#x201C;We teach our students to find opportunities where money can be made and where the opportunities for entrepreneurship are. We also teach them how to manage systems better, which is what companies and public sector organizations are often looking for.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Among the solutions presented was an app developed for DE-CRUIT, a theater company in New York that supports veterans&#x2019; reintegration into society through theater and the arts. The app enables the organization to keep in touch with veterans on any platform&#x2014;phone, laptop, tablet&#x2013; and includes an SOS button to link veterans to first-responders 24 hours a day.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Another solution was an electronic &#x201C;hubodometer&#x201D; that can be placed inside truck and bus wheels to record motion data that is more accurate than an odometer, which could help improve city management by lowering bus and truck maintenance costs. This particular solution was requested by Fleetwatch, a company that develops fleet management technologies that asked UTA students to solve a specific problem.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Some projects have even been successfully patented. A mechanical engineering senior design project for a smart bandage device that allows more efficient healing of wounds was recently patented with the help of Raytheon, the current employer of&#xA0;the student leader of the team.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our goal was to protect the wound and increase infection control,&#x201D; said team leader and mechanical engineering graduate Letia Blanco, who is now a lead engineer at Raytheon. &#x201C;Raytheon teamed up with UTA to secure the patent. It&#x2019;s very exciting.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The team also included Christopher Alberts, Kyle Godfrey, Andrew Patin and Chris Grace. Panos Shiakolas, associate professor in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department; and Pranesh Aswath, professor in the Materials Science and Engineering Department and vice provost for academic planning and policy, advised and guided the team to success.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Peter Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering, noted, &#x201C;These senior design project solutions are among the multiple initiatives we aim to develop across campus to promote entrepreneurship and innovation. Going forward, we will also draw in the local community more in ways that support burgeoning entrepreneurial ideas by both faculty and students.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p><b>Innovation Spaces</b></p>\n<p>Spaces also exist within the University to develop ideas. Faculty, staff, students and the community have access to the FabLab in the Central Library, a platform for project-based, hands-on science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (or STEAM) education. The UTA FabLab is the first MIT-affiliated FabLab in a university in Texas and enables students to develop a rich toolkit&#xA0;of professional, creative and technological skills.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>FabLab students recently surprised 8-year-old Garrett Clark with a custom-built prosthetic arm created at the lab. Garrett, who was born with a partial right arm, is the son of Andrew Clark, an associate professor at the University.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Adam Williams, a senior kinesiology major, was among those who helped design and build the fully functioning prosthetic arm from scratch.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The ability to think of something and then create it is just a rush,&#x201D; Williams said. Garrett will continue to visit the FabLab to make regular adjustments to his prosthetic until they are able to make the perfect fit for him.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The StartUp Lounge is a collision space where entrepreneurs can meet and interact.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>At the StartUp Lounge, UTA provides workshops and holds interactive discussions on topics that will help entrepreneurs move their business ideas or companies forward. Close to 400 students, faculty and community members have passed through the StartUp Lounge&#x2019;s EpICMavs&#xA0;and EpICMavs Deep Dive entrepreneurship courses.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>EpICMavs is an entrepreneurship workshop series designed by UTA in conjunction with mentors from TECH Fort Worth, a non-profit organization UTA strongly supports that identifies entrepreneurs and start-up companies and coaches them toward success. The current TECH Fort Worth Board of Directors includes Carolyn Cason, UTA&#x2019;s former vice president of research and a fellow of the National Academy of Inventors, and Lin Nelson, a UTA alumnus with a degree in finance.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>EpIC stands for Entrepreneurial, Innovative and Collaborative&#x2014;which is what UTA stands for. The EpICMavs sessions take place on Wednesday evenings at the StartUp Lounge and are open to faculty, staff, students and the community. Each session focuses on a particular topic of interest to entrepreneurs. The speakers or panelists begin the conversation and the attendees ask questions so everyone benefits from the knowledge and experience of others. Some sessions are hands-on workshops where participants work on their business ideas.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>EpICMavs Deep Dive is a seven-week cohort offered twice in the summer that provides UTA students and faculty the opportunity to receive hands-on mentoring while they work on their business ideas. The participants create a value proposition and business model canvas analysis of their business ideas under the guidance of mentors from TECH Fort Worth. Next, participants learn about financials and how to project the company&#x2019;s needs and expenditures over the first few years of the business. Finally, participants&#xA0;learn how to put together a pitch for any situation. Participants have the opportunity to practice 10-minute pitches and receive valuable feedback from entrepreneur mentors.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA alumnus and interdisciplinary studies major Scott Parsinen participated in the StartUp Lounge&#x2019;s many seminars and events. He has now established Cadmus Dental, a start-up that offers manufacturing of dental devices&#x2014;crowns, bridges, dentures and implant accessories- for its network members, largely dental laboratories and dentists.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I was given the opportunity by UTA to start Cadmus Dental at the StartUp Lounge, where I was able to participate in the EpICMavs program for entrepreneurs,&#x201D; Parsinen said. &#x201C;I attended the program in both the fall and spring semesters and learned an extraordinary amount from investors, community business leaders and UTA professors.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Additionally, I was able to network with amazing fellow entrepreneurs and get the support I needed during the difficult start-up process. When starting a company, no matter how much experience you have, there is no greater resource than UTA&#x2019;s EpIC Mavs,&#x201D; he added.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Parsinen has also developed additional opportunities for himself and UTA through these relationships. Cadmus Dental now has plans to employ UTA students and offer internships at its new office next to College Park Center. The company is using the online jobs database Hire-a-Maverick and has a growing relationship with the Lockheed Martin Career Development Center to identify potential employees from among UTA students. In addition, Cadmus has entered into a strategic partnership with UTA student-run start-up Ne&#xFC; Robotics to develop Cadmus proprietary intellectual property.</p>\n<p><b>Innovation Events and Pitch Competitions</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">UTA supports different ideas competitions and entrepreneurship clubs. The Office of Research sponsors an annual InnovationDay@UTA event for both high school and university students. This year&#x2019;s event featured a high school and college student &#x201C;Shark Tank&#x201D;-style competition, student&#xA0;and faculty start-up pitches and posters and a showcase of community start-up companies and services for entrepreneurs. The 2017 lunch speaker was Michael Chaffin, a business partner of Mark Cuban and UTA alumnus, who discussed his personal experience and offered advice to young entrepreneurs.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Within the College of Liberal Arts, the Art + Art History Department sponsors the Studio: CreaTec Challenge, an ideas competition to encourage student teams to develop viable solutions and sustainable ideas that successfully address the intersection of culture, business, and technology today. The initiative offers more than $10,000 in&#xA0;cash prizes and start-up resources. Activity spurred from this opportunity includes Artopia&#x2014;a series of art therapy workshops geared toward the service of the veteran population in the DFW region, including methods spreading from collage to gesture-based digital painting.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The student Entrepreneurship Society offers cash prizes in business plan pitch competitions that are open to any student enrolled at UTA, with faculty advisers from the College of Business.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The University also helps fund student and faculty participation in pitch competitions at other universities and even internationally. Last summer UTA participated in the K Start-up Grand Challenge, a pitch competition run by the Korean government, competing with pH sensor technology developed by Dr. Chiao. The UTA team was among those who spent three months at an accelerator in Korea working on their business and making contacts.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA philosophy student Tyler Sickels received an honorable mention in the finals of a Texas Christian University Values and Ventures Business Plan competition with SolGro, an agricultural research and manufacturing start-up with technology developed by physics professor Wei Chen. SolGro also won UTA&#x2019;s Innovation Day Competition and was named to the short list of the National Council of Entrepreneurial Tech Transfer&#x2019;s (NCET2) top university start-ups for 2017.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA start-up AbeXXa Biologics, led by biology professor and associate vice president for research Jon Weidanz, was selected as one of the NCET2 40 &#x201C;Best University Start-ups 2017.&#x201D; AbeXXa Biologics is a life science company focused on research and development of novel antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/robot-persp11.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>TechComb&apos;s modular, reconfigurable robot learning kit to increase interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics among K-12 students</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p><b>Office of Technology Management</b></p>\n<p>UTA leads in the policy arena around intellectual property rights and has a very proactive patenting and licensing office. Strong support from President Karbhari, who recently co-led a task-force that recommended a new University of Texas System policy that provides each campus greater autonomy in assigning intellectual property rights, is now making it easier to work with research sponsors to bring inventions to the market.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The Office of Technology Management works with UT System&#x2019;s Horizon Fund to fund start-up companies on campus and has set up a partnership with a UTA alumna in Silicon Valley to match the technology developed within the University with investors and corporate partners.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This relationship has already succeeded in licensing a chemical process developed by Kevin Schug, UTA&#x2019;s Shimadzu Distinguished Professor of Analytical Chemistry. This invention safely disposes of controlled substances and other unused medications, and has been licensed to the start-up Medisposal, Inc. in California. Other businesses opportunities are also under development at this time.</p>\n<p><b>Prototyping, Development and Business Consulting&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p>Dr. Dimos believes that UTA&#x2019;s support for entrepreneurs goes way beyond helping them license their technologies or establish new companies.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Through the University of Texas at Arlington Research Institute (UTARI) and the Texas Manufacturing Assistance Center (TMAC), we provide support for prototyping, development and business consulting right through to the marketing and commercialization of their ideas,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;The Shimadzu Institute for Research Technologies also provides support from basic research to supporting start-ups as they develop their research.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTARI provides a rapid, low-cost and reliable transition path for fundamental technologies to go to market.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>TechComb LLC is a UTA spinoff company that received an award from the National Science Foundation&#x2019;s Small Business Innovation Research Program to develop a modular, reconfigurable robot learning kit to increase interest in science, technology, engineering and mathematics among K-12 students. Aditya Das, senior research scientist at UTARI, developed the core technology for this project.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In the case of TechComb, UTARI is supporting technologies developed at UTA, but the Institute is also very actively supporting alumni and other small companies that need the capacities of a large university to achieve their commercialization goals,&#x201D; said Mickey McCabe, UTARI&#x2019;s executive director.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Lumion Labs is owned by UTA alumnus and entrepreneur Scott Evans, who reached into the University to commercialize UTA technologies and who now is in the final stages of testing and evaluating an environmentally friendly field analyzer to measure arsenic levels in water. The analyzer was developed by Dr. Purnendu &#x201C;Sandy&#x201D; Dasgupta and Dr. Aditya Das.&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Skyven Technologies, a local start-up, joined&#xA0;forces with the University to apply for a grant from the National Science Foundation&#x2019;s Small Business Innovation Research Program to develop a test model for cost-efficient solar energy technology.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Skyven Technologies is an example of a start-up partnering with a large university to gain access to equipment and federal funding to develop its proposal and become successful,&#x201D; Dr. McCabe added. &#x201C;These three cases&#x2014;TechComb, Lumion Labs, and Skyven Technology&#x2014;demonstrate the role of UTA in helping develop the start-up ecosystem and providing resources that enable bringing ideas into the market.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA assists with streamlining the management of start-ups and improving their operational efficiency through TMAC. Its services span the entire innovation timeline, from invention to selling the start-up to outside investors.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>TMAC is hosted at UTA and is an affiliate of the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership, a program of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Over the past five years, TMAC has supported 211 companies, with an economic impact in sales, cost savings and new investments of $238.7 million and more than 1,486 jobs created or retained.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The University&#x2019;s resources at the Shimadzu Institute for Research Technologies provide important support for start-ups. Currently, two of UTA&#x2019;s start-ups, AbeXXa Biologics and Resonant Sensors, are housed at the Shimadzu Institute for Research Technologies in the NanoFab building on campus.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The equipment in the Shimadzu Institute labs would be prohibitively expensive for a start-up company to purchase on its own, so having access to this equipment can be key to its development efforts. Companies can submit samples to be analyzed by UTA scientists, or they can visit the lab and be trained to use the instrumentation themselves. Shimadzu leadership has strong experience in both the public and private sectors and offers technical and entrepreneurial advice to companies as needed.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><b>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p>UTA stands as an institution that Is rapidly maturing an innovation ecosystem with a robust pipeline of new inventions that are moving out into the market to benefit society.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This ecosystem integrates the development of an innovation culture among faculty and students with specialized curricula and workshops around entrepreneurship. Facets that promote a vibrant entrepreneurial culture on campus and in the broader community include: capstone senior design projects, innovation workspaces, support for innovation events and pitch competitions, a proactive office of technology management with links to the investment community, support for prototyping and development and business consulting for new companies. Many of these resources are also available to UTA&#x2019;s 200,000 alumni and business leaders and residents of Texas.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is poised to expand and grow its partnerships with external stakeholders around the world such as government, investors, and entrepreneurs, as well as peer institutions with similar objectives, to become an even stronger force for economic growth,&#x201D; said President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;Together we are becoming a major driver for innovation and entrepreneurship in North Texas.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The variety of approaches and best practices deployed at UTA are a reflection of the sustained diverse history of of the institution and the urban audiences it serves, its increased visibility as a Carnegie Classification Research &#x2013; 1 University, its ideal location in the heart of the dynamic and thriving Dallas-Fort Worth area, and its pivotal role as one of the largest public research institutions in Texas.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201D;Under our Strategic Plan 2020 Bold Solutions|Global Impact, the University aims to be at the vanguard of nurturing budding entrepreneurs who will create products, services and high-quality jobs in our community and contribute to the world through their intellectual talent and unwavering fearlessness,&#x201D; said President Karbhari.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><b>Some 60 faculty and students are currently working on start-ups and more</b></p>\n<p><b>than 20 start-up companies are developing around UTA, in line with the</b></p>\n<p><b>themes of our Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact.

        "body": "\n<p>A University of Texas at Arlington team will inspect 350 concrete manhole shafts for corrosion in the city of Arlington and develop a method to prioritize which manholes need protection from corrosion the most.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Melanie Sattler\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/sattler.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Melanie Sattler, a UTA associate professor of civil engineering, is leading a UTA team that will evaluate condition of some City of Arlington manholes.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The Arlington City Council approved the three-year $474,723 project that will measure the hydrogen sulfide and multiple other parameters that influence manhole corrosion. Each manhole is four to five feet in diameter and in Arlington can range from four to 45 feet tall.</p>\n<p>Corrosion of manhole shafts can threaten the structure integrity of sanitary sewer mains and can allow rain and other runoff from the surface to enter the wastewater system.</p>\n<p>Buzz Pishkur, city of Arlington&apos;s water utilities director, said, &#x201C;The new study will give Arlington water engineers and other cities across the country the data they need to protect vital infrastructure and spend funds wisely. UTA is a renowned center for the&#xA0;study of pipe technology and evaluation of alternate pipeline materials&#xA0;to meet the needs of cities.&#xA0;We are fortunate to have a center of research in our city and value the partnership on this and other key infrastructure efforts.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Melanie Sattler, UTA associate professor and the Syed Qasim Endowed Professor of Civil Engineering, will lead the project. Victoria Chen, the George &amp; Elizabeth Pickett Professor in the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering; and Arpita Bhatt, an adjunct professor in civil engineering; are on the team.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It makes sense for Arlington to develop a system for prioritizing protection of its manholes,&#x201D; Sattler said. &#x201C;Manholes can corrode because of the creation of hydrogen sulfide gas. Some readings can be really, really high. We will determine which manholes need a protective coating to protect them from corrosion. To coat all of them would not be feasible.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Arlington manhole\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/manhole-cover-sattler.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Sattler&apos;s project with the city will evaluate manholes like the one pictured above.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Microbes in the sewer convert the hydrogen sulfide gas to sulfuric acid, which then corrodes the manhole concrete. Sulfuric acid also corrodes the pipes adjacent to the manholes.</p>\n<p>Sattler said the team will use sensors to measure the amount of hydrogen sulfide, study velocity of flow and inspect corrosion that might already be underway to determine which manholes need help first.</p>\n<p>Arlington has more than 19,000 manholes citywide. The UTA project will inspect different categories, types and geographic locations of Arlington manholes.</p>\n<p>Although the study will prioritize corrosion protection of the 350 manholes, the more important aspect of the project is to use the data from the 350 to develop a system so the city can prioritize the rest of the manholes.</p>\n<p>Sattler said this is a companion project of sorts with UTA&#x2019;s Ali Abolmaali&#x2019;s Large Diameter Sanitary Sewer Assessment Program with the city of Arlington that was granted in 2015.</p>\n<p>That project employs a robot to inspect miles of the city&#x2019;s sewer pipes. It, too, will be used to prioritize the city&#x2019;s pipes so that better decisions can be made to repair the ones that need it most.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s exciting that UTA is at the forefront of helping the city of Arlington,&#x201D; said Abolmaali, chair of the Department of Civil Engineering and the Tseng Huang Endowed Professor of Civil Engineering. &#x201C;UTA professors further investigate and discover the tools of their trade in these collaborations. UTA students receive vital field work experience in collecting the data in these projects.&#x201D;</p>\n"

Each of the 12 research lab neighborhoods will accommodate multiple teams in a wide range of fields, from biology to bioengineering to computational research to nursing and kinesiology.</p>\n<p>The winning proposals for this year&#x2019;s Interdisciplinary Research Grants are:</p>\n<p><b>T-Cell mimicking nanoparticles for targeted delivery of chemo-drugs to effectively treat melanoma</b></p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption650\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/schemetmnp.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>T-Cell mimicking nanoparticles for targeted delivery of chemo-drugs to effectively treat melanoma</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Kytai Nguyen in bioengineering; Jon Weidanz in biology; Vinay Abhyankar of the UTA Research Institute and Jean Gao in computer science and engineering have already developed a prototype for a new drug-loaded nanoparticle, which is cloaked with the plasma membrane of an immune or T-cell. This T-cell mimicking nanoparticle can recognize melanoma cells, bind with them to deliver drugs and kill the cell.</p>\n<p>For this new project, the team aims to further test the treatment using a device that can replicate human melanoma on a chip.</p>\n<p><b>Mathematical modeling of dynamics of calcium codes for drugs evaluation</b></p>\n<p>Benito Chen-Charpentier in mathematics; Hristo Kojouharov in mathematics and Zui Pan in nursing will develop a mathematical model to simulate dynamics of intracellular calcium signaling and apply it for a rapid and cost-effective evaluation for chemotherapy drugs.</p>\n<p>Almost 40 percent of all modern drugs are targeted at different cell surface receptors, which reshape intracellular calcium signaling and affect cell growth and death. Pan&#x2019;s group already has shown that intracellular calcium oscillations affect tumor development in esophageal cancer cells.</p>\n<p>The researchers plan to test their hypothesis that a mathematical model to simulate the dynamics of intracellular calcium signaling can predict the overall impact of one or combined chemotherapies on intracellular calcium codes. This will provide guidance to search for effective combinations to chemotherapy drugs in a much more rapid and cost-effective way. Currently available research data from Pan&#x2019;s group will help support the project.</p>\n<p><b>GOE! Pilot testing a community gardening and outdoor engagement intervention to reduce health disparities among homeless youth</b></p>\n<p>Courtney Cronley in social work; Larry Nelson in kinesiology and David Hopman in landscape architecture plan to design and test a project called GOE!- Gardening and Outdoor Engagement &#x2013; that aims to increase the physical activity and improve mental health among youth who are homeless and at high risk of negative mental, physical and behavioral health outcomes.</p>\n<p>The long-term goal of the project is to develop a manual, evidence-based curriculum GOE! that can be replicated in similar communities nationally. The project will use advanced data collection technologies already available in the School of Social Work, the Department of Kinesiology, and use the UTA Urban Farm, sponsored by the Department of Landscape Architecture, as the test site.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;All these projects demonstrate UTA&#x2019;s capacity to create really innovative approaches through interdisciplinary research,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;We fully expect these projects to be funded by federal agencies and become inventions and methodologies that reach the market.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>\n<p>This year marks the third year of the Interdisciplinary Research Program, which has funded a total of 12 projects.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Streicher received his doctorate from UTA in 2012 and was a postdoctoral researcher in Fujita&#x2019;s lab in 2012-13.</p>\n<p>Fujita and his colleagues hope the study&#x2019;s results will provide &#x201C;deep insight into the constraints and opportunities of vision systems to evolving novel solutions to new life history modes and behaviors, a topic of primary importance in understanding drivers of diversification throughout the tree of life.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This project aims to understand the evolution of the frog eye using genomic, morphological, physiological, and spectrophotometric or light absorbance data,&#x201D; Fujita said. &#x201C;The diversity of life history strategies of frogs &#x2013; which include nocturnal, diurnal, arboreal (living in trees), and fossorial (living underground) lifestyles &#x2013; provides an excellent opportunity to investigate how differences in habitat and behavior affect the functions of the eye.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>One example, Fujita says, is frogs that live underground tend to have small eyes because of their reduced environmental complexity compared to visual signals experienced by frogs living above ground. While these frogs exhibit the morphological reduction in eyes, do they also have a reduction in the genetic machinery that allow eyes to function? Fujita hopes that this is one of many questions the project will answer.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Frogs are thus an excellent system to understand how the eye evolves in the face of vast differences in life history that reflect adaptations to distinct habitats,&#x201D; Fujita said. &#x201C;Our integrative approach will provide detailed and comprehensive insight into vision evolution across life history transitions in frogs and addresses a central gap in our overall understanding of vertebrate vision evolution.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/frogeyes.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Images of frog eyes</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>In order to understand vision systems at a broad scale first, the researchers will collect data across 27 families to generate a comprehensive appreciation of vision diversity and evolution in frogs. Molecular evolutionary studies will provide a genomic perspective on vision evolution with the expectation that visually-oriented frogs exhibit greater levels of natural selection, gene duplication, and retention of vision genes.</p>\n<p>Characterizing the physiology and molecular underpinnings of vision in species with aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial adults will reveal how the visual system adapts to distinct visual environments during metamorphosis. These broad studies will provide a framework for more focused investigations that target transitions in sexual dichromatism &#x2013; the difference in coloration of sexes within a given species &#x2013; and fossoriality.</p>\n<p>The NSF grant will also support several graduate research assistants in Fujita&#x2019;s lab, including T.J. Firneno, who will help establish a data management plan to consolidate all of the different data types that the project will utilize. Fujita and his students have already started collecting frog and toad specimens from Texas. They plan to continue collecting specimens in the United States and in Gabon this fall, and in Brazil, Australia and Ecuador over the next year.</p>\n<p>The project will provide graduate, undergraduate and high school students with research experience that includes fieldwork, morphological measurements of specimens, molecular lab procedures including sequencing at UTA&#x2019;s Genomics Core Facility, and computational analysis, Fujita said.</p>\n<p>Clay Clark, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Biology, said the project has the potential to fill in significant gaps in scientists&#x2019; knowledge about the effects of evolutionary processes on vision, and also furthers the University&#x2019;s goal to do important research in data-driven discovery, one of the main pillars of its Strategic Plan 2020: <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</a></p>\n<p>&#x201C;With this project, Dr. Fujita and his collaborators could answer some key questions about how changes in vision are influenced by the habitat in which an animal lives,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;The fact that he is leading this project which includes scientists from two of the pre-eminent research museums in the world speaks volumes about Dr. Fujita&#x2019;s skills as a researcher and about the caliber of work being done in the College of Science.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Fujita came to UTA in 2012.&#xA0; He received a Ph.D. in Integrative Biology from the University of California at Berkeley in 2009. His research focuses on genomics, systematics, and herpetology. The goal of his lab group is to understand patterns and processes that generate the tremendous biodiversity found in reptiles and amphibians at multiple phylogenetic, geographic, and genomic scales.</p>\n"

It is considered one of the major problems afflicting school-age children around the world. Symptoms include poor balance and coordination and underdeveloped handwriting skills. They struggle with basic childhood activities such as riding bicycles. Children with DCD tend to have limited or no athletic ability, are more sedentary and therefore more prone to obesity. They also are more likely to suffer from low self-esteem.</p>\n<p>Many children with autism spectrum disorder have traits commonly found in those with DCD. But the researchers sought to highlight some of the differences, including working memory ability and their ability to grasp things like pencils properly with their hands. They found that there are more differences than similarities.</p>\n<p>Ca&#xE7;ola is an expert on DCD. She is the director of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/littlemavs/\" target=\"_blank\">Little Mavs Movement Academy</a>, a free group intervention program designed to improve the motor skills of children age four to 16.</p>\n<p>Ca&#xE7;ola and her colleagues analyzed 11 articles that highlighted differences between individuals with ASD and DCD. While there are many similarities and some overlap between the two conditions, they are not identical. The researchers say that for this reason, medical professionals should be more aggressive about finding signs of DCD in children with autism.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Motor skills are the root of DCD but they are also really important in autism,&#x201D; Ca&#xE7;ola said. &#x201C;When autism is diagnosed, motor skills are not the primary concern. But we also found that that there is a lot of co-occurrence of DCD in autism. A lot of individuals may have autism but they are not assessed for DCD. We really need to assess for DCD in children with autism and the earlier the better.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Ca&#xE7;ola said the notion that DCD can be present in autism is new and gaining more attention because more people now recognize the importance of having strong motor skills. Poor motor skills, if left unchecked, can have lifelong consequences for children in nearly every sphere of their lives, she said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Poor motor skills could be impairing social skills even more,&#x201D; she added.</p>\n<p>Anne Bavier, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation, called Ca&#xE7;ola&#x2019;s study an important contribution to the still evolving body of knowledge on DCD.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;Priscila&#x2019;s scholarly work coupled with her expertise and passion for tackling DCD has the potential to touch the lives of exponentially more children, not only here in the DFW area but around the country and around the world,&#x201D; Bavier said.</p>\n"

Cawthon&#x2019;s impact on the University stretches back to 1988, when she first joined UTA. In addition to serving as interim dean, Cawthon has been an undergraduate advisor, honors advisor, associate chair of the department of history and associate dean for academic affairs. She received The University of Texas System Regents&#x2019; Outstanding Teaching Award in 2012, recognizing her for exceptional teaching at the undergraduate level.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>One of Cawthon&#x2019;s most impactful contributions to UTA is the founding of the College of Liberal Art&#x2019;s Pre-Law Center, which provides&#xA0;resources for students considering law school and law-related careers. As founding director, Cawthon facilitated raising more than $700,000 for the Pre-Law Center. The center provides students opportunities to engage in extensive service learning, most notably with Legal Aid of North West Texas, and currently serves more than 500 students&#xA0;in varied majors&#xA0;throughout campus. Graduates have gone on to&#xA0;secure scholarships at top-ten law schools across the nation.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Cawthon also designed the center&#x2019;s mentorship program, matching students with practicing attorneys, many of them UTA graduates working in fields of interest to the mentees. &#xA0;While interim dean, Cawthon introduced minors and certificates at the college to meet job market demands in growing fields such as 3-D design, gaming and new media communication.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Cawthon is a proven leader who has already had a tremendous impact on the College of Liberal Arts,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;Under her leadership, the college launched new initiatives which increased cross-disciplinary collaboration among faculty members. She has strengthened existing programs as well as provided students opportunities to be creative thinkers and global leaders. Dr. Cawthon&#x2019;s talent and passion will help the college&#x2019;s students, faculty and staff soar to new heights.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>As dean, Cawthon will lead UTA&#x2019;s fourth largest college, which has more than 4,500 students and 400 faculty members. The College of Liberal Arts has four centers, 13 departments and 47 majors under social sciences, humanities and fine arts. The college is home to graduate programs ranked among the nation&#x2019;s best by <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>.</p>\n<p>Cawthon has been instrumental in implementing the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact</a> with a strong emphasis on grant-funded interdisciplinary research opportunities, a focus on digital humanities and big data. She is also expanding internships, service learning and study abroad opportunities for liberal arts students who want to connect with prospective employers and make an impact in their communities.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Cawthon cares deeply about the entire student experience at UTA. She is committed to exposing students to rigorous coursework, valuable experiential learning opportunities and lively intellectual discussions led by top notch faculty,&#x201D; said Teik C. Lim, UTA Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs.&#xA0; &#x201C;College of Liberal Arts graduates are creative, strategic thinkers who make an immediate impact on industry and the arts, which is a credit to Dr. Cawthon&#x2019;s leadership.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Cawthon is committed to recruiting and retaining world-class faculty members. During her time as interim dean, she launched a seed grant initiative providing $200,000 to faculty for interdisciplinary research projects.&#xA0; The grants focused on Digital Arts and Humanities, Health and the Human Condition, and entrepreneurship and innovation, and have helped faculty secure external funding to expand their research such as the digitization of more than 500,000 pages of unique documents that record the history of the African diaspora in the seven oldest cities of Cuba.</p>\n<p>&quot;The College of Liberal Arts&#xA0;is an extremely diverse and energetic&#xA0;college within a dynamic&#xA0;institution,&#x201D; Cawthon said. &#x201C;It is an honor for me to&#xA0;have a role in guiding students, showcasing faculty, supporting staff, connecting with community and&#xA0;contributing to&#xA0;the university.&quot;</p>\n<p>Wayne Watts, retired Senior Executive Vice President and General Counsel of AT&amp;T, Inc., has been one of the Pre-Law Center&#x2019;s biggest supporters since its inception.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Elisabeth is a rare individual who is kind and generous as well as highly intellectual and remarkably determined,&#x201D; Watts said. &#x201C;She is a strong leader who is incredibly dedicated to her students. As a graduate of UTA, I applaud the university&#x2019;s decision to elevate Elisabeth to Dean of the College of Liberal Arts. I am excited to watch the college and the Pre-Law Center continue to blossom.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Cawthon received a bachelor of arts in history and political science from Louisiana Tech and a master of arts and Ph.D. in legal history from The University of Virginia.

It impresses businesses in this type of industry and many, many of these students are hired into the top jobs in the industry.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Autocross is a form of racing involving a pattern of sweeping and hairpin turns, slaloms and straightaways. Cars race against the clock. The best time wins.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, Woods said the best team gets bragging rights until next year&#x2019;s meet.</p>\n<p>Racing starts at 9 a.m. Saturday, July 8, on <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/maps/?id=242\">Lot 49</a> on the UTA campus. It&#x2019;s at the southeast corner of Mitchell and Cooper streets. Saturday will be a competition on the traditional endurance course in the morning and a different course in the afternoon. A drivers meeting is at 8 a.m. Volunteers from the Texas Region of Sports Car Club of America will handle timing. Parking for viewing is located just east of the racetrack.</p>\n<p>Several universities are attending this year, including teams from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico and others. Some schools will bring more than one car to the event.</p>\n<p>Racing continues at 9 a.m. Sunday, July 9, on Lot 49 for the collegiate teams. Woods stressed that the racing isn&#x2019;t official but all the teams do watch the clock.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Another strength of the event is the camaraderie that builds among the participants. They learn from each other,&#x201D; Woods said. &#x201C;Those alliances sometimes last for decades, well past the degrees the participants earn at their schools. Sometimes that networking carries on in the professional world as well.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The UTA team has an extensive alumni base, many of whom come back to visit the program. The team also has many, many sponsors. One of the more active sponsors is Arnold Petsche, who donated $1 million to the UTA College of Engineering to establish the Arnold E. Petsche Center for Automotive Engineering.</p>\n<p>The Center promotes engineering education, innovation and entrepreneurship, especially through student participation in the Formula Society of Automotive Engineers program, which Woods advises.</p>\n<p>Woods was honored in 2013 with the Society of Automotive Engineers&#x2019; Excellence in Engineering Education Award for his contributions in engineering education. He was named a <a href=\"../05/woods-minnie-stevens-piper.php\">2017 Piper Professor</a> by the San Antonio-based Minnie Stevens Piper Foundation and recently received the prestigious University of Texas System Regents&#x2019; Outstanding Teaching Award.&#xA0;</p>\n"

Hong&#x2019;s technology is a significant advancement over conventional conductive polymers that are very stiff, hard to be processed and non-degradable.</p>\n<p>In April, he was awarded a $200,000 R21 grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop materials that will allow doctors to use a 3-D printer to create unique new blood vessels for children with vascular defects.</p>\n<p>Hong&#x2019;s research, and that of his colleagues across the University, is an example of excellence in <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a>, one of the themes of the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact</a>, said Michael Cho, professor and chair of the Bioengineering Department.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is indeed an honor to be elected as a Fellow of the American Heart Association,&#x201D; said Cho. &#x201C;It recognizes Dr.&#xA0;Hong&#x2019;s scientific accomplishments by one of the most influential organizations of cardiovascular and stroke professionals. The fact that he was named a Fellow while he is an assistant professor speaks volumes of his research prowess and the clinical importance of design and application of biomaterials to cardiovascular diseases and potential tissue repair.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Hong has been the primary investigator on research grants totaling more than $1 million since beginning his career, including an American Heart Association grant to develop a bioactive heart patch that will help restore heart function after a heart attack. He also has been involved with other projects as a co-principal investigator in that time. His research interests include biomaterials, tissue engineering, medical devices and drug delivery.</p>\n<p>Hong holds 10 issued/applied patents and has authored or co-authored more than 60 journal articles. He is a member of the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society, the Biomedical Engineering Society and the Society for Biomaterials.</p>\n<p>He earned his doctoral degree at Zhejiang University in 2005 and was a post-doctoral associate and research assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh&#x2019;s McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, where he received PITT Innovator Awards in 2009 and 2010. He joined the UTA Department of Bioengineering in 2012.</p>\n<p>Hong is the fourth AHA Fellow in the Bioengineering Department, joining Jun Liao, Kytai Nguyen, and Liping Tang. Beth Mancini, a senior associate dean in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, is also a fellow of the organization.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s growing Bioengineering Department is a leader in engineering solutions for cardiovascular disease. In addition to Hong&#x2019;s grants, the department recently won a <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/bioengineering/t32-doctoral-training.php\">National Institutes of Health T-32 grant</a> that allows it to subsidize and train doctoral students in healthcare applications for nanotechnology, specifically to develop tools to battle cardiovascular and pulmonary ailments.

Credits: Todd Castoe</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Evolution takes eons, but it leaves marks on the genomes of organisms that can be detected with DNA sequencing and analysis.</p>\n<p>As methods for studying and comparing genetic data improve, scientists are beginning to decode these marks to reconstruct the evolutionary history of species, as well as how variants of genes give rise to unique traits.</p>\n<p>A research team at the University of Texas at Arlington led by assistant professor of biology Todd Castoe has been exploring the genomes of snakes and lizards to answer critical questions about these creatures&#x2019; evolutionary history. For instance, how did they develop venom? How do they regenerate their organs? And how do evolutionarily-derived variations in genes lead to variations in how organisms look and function?</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Some of the most basic questions drive our research, including &#x2018;why do different organisms look and function differently,&#x2019; says Castoe. &#x201C;Yet trying to understand the genetic explanations of such questions is surprisingly difficult considering most vertebrate genomes, including our own, are made up of literally billions of DNA bases that can determine how an organism looks and functions. Understanding these links between differences in DNA and differences in form and function is central to understanding biology and disease, and investigating these critical links requires massive computing power.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>To uncover new insights that link variation in DNA with variation in vertebrate form and function, Castoe&#x2019;s group uses supercomputing and data analysis resources at the Texas Advanced Computing Center or TACC, one of the world&#x2019;s leading centers for computational discovery.</p>\n<p>Recently, they used TACC&#x2019;s supercomputers to understand the mechanisms by which Burmese pythons regenerate their organs &#x2014; including their heart, liver, kidney, and small intestines &#x2014; after feeding.</p>\n<p>Burmese pythons (as well as other snakes) massively downregulate their metabolic and physiological functions during extended periods of fasting. During this time their organs atrophy, saving energy. However, upon feeding, the size and function of these organs, along with their ability to generate energy, dramatically increase to accommodate digestion.</p>\n<p>Within 48&#xA0;hours of feeding, Burmese pythons can undergo up to a 44-fold increase in metabolic rate and the mass of their major organs can increase by 40 to 100 percent.</p>\n<p>Writing in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5412052/\"><i>BMC Genomics</i></a> in May 2017, the researchers described their efforts to compare gene expression in pythons. They sequenced pythons that were fasting, one day post-feeding and four days post-feeding. From those sequences, they identified 1,700 genes that were significantly different pre- and post-feeding, and performed statistical analyses to identify the key drivers of organ regeneration across different types of tissues.</p>\n<p>They found that a few key sets of genes were driving the wholesale change of pythons&#x2019; internal organ structure. A small number of key proteins, produced and regulated by these important genes, activated a cascade of diverse, tissue-specific signals that led to regenerative organ growth.</p>\n<p>Even mammalian cells have been shown to respond to serum produced by post-feeding pythons, suggesting that the signaling function is conserved across species and could one day be used to improve human health.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re interested in understanding the molecular basis of this phenomenon to see what genes are regulated related to the feeding response,&#x201D; says Daren Card, a doctoral student in Castoe&#x2019;s lab and one of the authors of the study. &#x201C;Our hope is that we can leverage our understanding of how snakes accomplish organ regeneration to one day help treat human diseases.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/9wikimediacommons_python-3-copy.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Picture of a Burmese python. Credits: Wikimedia Commons.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p><b>Making Evolutionary Sense of Secondary Contact</b></p>\n<p>Castoe and his team used related genomic approaches to understand gene flow in closely related species of western rattlesnakes with an intertwined genetic history.</p>\n<p>The two species live on opposite sides of the Continental Divide in Mexico and the U.S. and were separated for thousands of years. They evolved in response to different climates and habitat. However, over time their geographic ranges came back together to the point that the rattlesnakes began to crossbreed, leading to hybrids, some of which live in a region between the two distinct climates.</p>\n<p>The rattlesnake research aimed to understand what genetic traits are important when species evolve in isolation, and whether these same genetic attributes, or alternative ones, are important during <i>secondary contact</i> &#x2013; where species that have diverged through long exposure to different conditions in different geographic regions, later come back in contact to each other when those conditions and geographic ranges change.</p>\n<p>This work was motivated by a desire to understand what forces generate and maintain distinct species, and how shifts in the ranges of species (for example, due to global change) may impact species and speciation.</p>\n<p>The researchers compared thousands of genes in the rattlesnakes&#x2019; nuclear DNA to study genomic differentiation between the two lineages.</p>\n<p>Their comparisons revealed a relationship between genetic traits that are most important in evolution during isolation and those that are most important during secondary contact, with greater-than-expected overlap between genes in these two scenarios.</p>\n<p>However, there are also regions of the rattlesnake genome that are important in only one of these two scenarios. For example, genes functioning in venom composition and in reproductive differences &#x2014; distinct traits that are important for adaptation to the local habitat &#x2014; likely diverged under selection when these species were isolated. They also found other sets of genes that were not originally important for diversification of form and function, that later became important in reducing the viability of hybrids. Overall, their results provide a genome-scale perspective on how speciation might work that can be tested and refined in studies of other species.</p>\n<p>The team published their results in the April 2017 issue of <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.2996/full\"><i>Ecology and Evolution</i></a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption650\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/2castoe_pythonimage-heatmap-copy.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Image of a Burmese python super-imposed on top of analyses of gene expression that changes in its organs upon feeding.

First, they use advanced computing to create genome assemblies &#x2013; putting millions of small chunks of DNA in the correct order.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Vertebrate genomes are typically on the larger side, so it takes a lot of computational power to assemble them,&#x201D; says Card. &#x201C;We use TACC a lot for that.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Next, the researchers use advanced computing to compare the results among many different samples, from multiple lineages, to identify subtle differences and patterns that would not be distinguishable otherwise.</p>\n<p>Castoe&#x2019;s lab has their own in-house computers, but they fall short of what is needed to perform all of the studies the group is interested in working on.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In terms of genome assemblies and the very intensive analyses we do, accessing larger resources from TACC is advantageous,&#x201D; Card says. &#x201C;Certain things benefit substantially from the general output from TACC machines, but they also allow us to run 500 jobs at the same time, which speeds up the research process considerably.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>A third computer-driven approach lets the team simulate the process of genetic evolution over millions of generations using synthetic biological data to deduce the rules of evolution, and to identify genes that may be important for adaptation.</p>\n<p>For one such project, the team developed a new software tool called <i>GppFst</i> that allows researchers to differentiate <i>genetic drift</i> &#x2013; a neutral process whereby genes and gene sequences naturally change due to random mating within a population &#x2013; from <i>genetic variations</i> that are indicative of evolutionary changes caused by natural selection.</p>\n<p>The tool uses simulations to statistically determine which changes are meaningful and can help biologists better understand the processes that underlie genetic variation. They described the tool in the May 2017 issue of <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw795\"><i>Bioinformatics</i></a><i>.</i></p>\n<p>Lab members are able to access TACC resources through a unique initiative, called the University of Texas Research Cyberinfrastructure, which gives researchers from the state&#x2019;s 14 public universities and health centers access to TACC&#x2019;s systems and staff expertise.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s been integral to our research,&#x201D; said Richard Adams, another doctoral student in Castoe&#x2019;s group and the developer of <i>GppFst</i>. &#x201C;We simulate large numbers of different evolutionary scenarios. For each, we want to have hundreds of replicates, which are required to fully vet our conclusions. There&#x2019;s no way to do that on our in-house systems. It would take 10 to 15 years to finish what we would need to do with our own machines &#x2013; frankly, it would be impossible without the use of TACC systems.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Though the roots of evolutionary biology can be found in field work and close observation, today, the field is deeply tied to computing, since the scale of genetic material &#x2013; tiny but voluminous -- cannot be viewed with the naked eye or put in order by an individual.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The massive scale of genomes, together with rapid advances in gathering genome sequence information, has shifted the paradigm for many aspects of life science research,&#x201D; says Castoe.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The bottleneck for discovery is no longer the generation of data, but instead is the analysis of such massive datasets. Data that takes less than a few weeks to generate can easily take years to analyze, and flexible shared supercomputing resources like TACC have become more critical than ever for advancing discovery in our field, and broadly for the life-sciences.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>UT System researchers that would like to learn more about expanding their research by leveraging UT System-supported TACC resources should visit the <a href=\"http://useta.cc/utrc\">University of Texas Research Cyberinfrastructure page</a> or email <a href=\"mailto:utrc@tacc.utexas.edu\">utrc@tacc.utexas.edu</a>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"
