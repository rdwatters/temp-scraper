In early 2019, a multi-species rapid tissue loss disease matching the description of stony coral tissue loss disease was discovered severely affecting a reef off the southwest coast of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p>The disease has been devastating coral reef communities off the southeast coast of Florida since 2014 and was recently reported in other areas of the Caribbean, including Mexico, St. Martin and Jamaica. Scientists believe it will likely spread across the U.S. Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.</p><p>&#x201C;My lab will assess immunity and disease resistance in coral based on a unique combination of immune phenotypes including expressed genes and protein activity,&#x201D; Mydlarz said. &#x201C;This approach of full transcriptome sequencing, paired with analysis models that include organismal phenotypes, will allow us to build pathways and turn groups of genes into immune traits.&#x201D;</p><p>Stony coral tissue loss disease differs from the &#x201C;bleaching&#x201D; that is damaging coral reefs around the world. Bleaching is caused by thermal stress and begins by killing symbiotic algae that live on corals. There is a possibility that bleached corals can recover over time. Stony coral tissue loss disease appears to be a spreading pathogen and is capable of killing an entire coral in five weeks, according to Marilyn Brandt, University of the Virgin Islands research associate professor of marine and environmental science and lead investigator of the project.</p><p>Researchers will perform experiments to discover how this disease affects coral species&#x2019; immune traits and compare the microbiology and physiology of disease samples in the Virgin Islands to samples from Florida. They will also examine how changing the species composition of a coral community affects the spread and impact of the disease.</p><p>&#x201C;The onset of this [outbreak] in the USVI offers an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses about the impact of coral resistance, tolerance and immune traits on disease spread during the early stages of an outbreak that could profoundly change the diversity of Caribbean reefs,&#x201D; the researchers wrote in their abstract for the project.</p><p>Mydlarz and her colleagues hope that the study will provide a better understanding of how the abundance of highly susceptible host species impacts the spread of disease during the early onset of a multi-species outbreak over a wide geographic area.</p><p>In addition to UTA, the project includes researchers from the University of the Virgin Islands, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution of Massachusetts, Rice University, Louisiana State University and Mote Marine Laboratory of Florida.</p><p>Clay Clark, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Biology, said the project can provide important information for the battle against coral disease and reef loss, and noted that it expands UTA&#x2019;s footprint in the area of global environmental impact.</p><p>&#x201C;The team that Dr. Mydlarz is a part of is doing critical work in the fight against coral disease and coral reef loss,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;If they&#x2019;re able to create a model to help predict what effect the spread of disease has on coral reefs, it would be a significant step forward in helping scientists devise the best way to fight these diseases.&#x201D;</p>"

But Zhou is investigating the theory that ALS affects the physiology of the whole body through defective cells in multiple organs.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Twelve years ago, my lab made a discovery in the muscle defects of ALS, and we have been looking closely at the disease ever since,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;In the beginning, we believed the muscle atrophy ALS causes was secondary to the death of the neurons in the spinal cord, but we have evidence that indicates the muscle is not only a victim of the disease, rather it actively contributes to it. This is a systemic disorder affecting the whole body.&#x201D;</p><p>A respected leader in her field, Zhou has published more than 70 peer-reviewed articles and received more than $4 million in grants in the last decade. She recently received a $2.88 million award from the National Institutes of Health and was invited to serve as a member of the NIH Center for Scientific Review&#x2019;s Skeletal Muscle and Exercise Physiology Study Section.</p><p>The NIH grant supports Zhou&#x2019;s work to preserve mitochondria as it functions or dysfunctions in a diseased cell&#x2014;part of her pursuit to understand the mechanisms behind why multiple organs are involved in ALS deterioration.</p><p>&#x201C;We are ultimately working to find some potential therapeutic means to treat the disease with a new understanding,&#x201D; Zhou said. &#x201C;Once we understand why the cells are damaged, we can test potential compounds or therapies.&#x201D;</p><p>The NIH-funded study is the continuation of a project Zhou started with funding from the ALS Association. Zhou&#x2019;s was one of 58 labs selected to receive grants funded by donations raised in 2014 through the viral ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.</p><p>Since Zhou began her work on ALS, she has heard countless stories of how the disease has impacted patients and their families. These personal stories, she says, motivate her to keep going.</p><p>Paul Fadel, CONHI&#x2019;s associate dean for research, said Zhou&#x2019;s expertise fortifies the College&#x2019;s reputation as an innovative center for research and advances UTA&#x2019;s pursuit of being a leader in serving <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Zhou&#x2019;s research explores new territories in an effort to bring relief to ALS patients and their families,&#x201D; Fadel said. &#x201C;Her work is groundbreaking, and she plays an essential role in the growth and leadership of the Bone-Muscle Research Center. She is a renowned expert in the field and an enthusiastic collaborator that strengthens our faculty and student experience. We are fortunate to have Dr. Zhou on our team at UTA.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou came to UTA in July 2018 as associate director of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/research/bmrc/index.php\">Bone-Muscle Research Center</a>.&#xA0; Zhou said she was attracted to UTA because of the opportunity for collaborative research the new Science &amp; Engineering Innovation &amp; Research Building provides.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption250\"><img alt id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/jingsong-zhou-lab-action.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>&#x201C;I was looking for a big stage, a big scientific environment, and that&#x2019;s what UTA offered,&#x201D; Zhou said. &#x201C;The SEIR Building and collaboration through our Bone-Muscle Research Center helps us be more competitive for funding. That allows us to do better science, make a stronger impact on the research field and provide significant benefits for our society.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou&#x2019;s work in examining mitochondria in diseased cells in cases of ALS has translated to other areas of medical research. In February, she was awarded a $610,000 grant from the NIH to apply the concept to the heart muscle in cases of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>&#x201C;When you look at cells through a microscope, it&#x2019;s the same as looking through a telescope at the universe&#x2014;the discoveries are infinite,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s extremely important to take our time to explore and understand as many elements of the disease as possible so we can fight it efficiently.&#x201D;</p><p>&#xA0;</p>"

We are able to offer exceptional experiences and preparation in both formats without sacrificing excellence.&#x201D;</p><p>The College of Education&#x2019;s undergraduate and graduate students are the backbone of public education in North Texas, serving as principals, superintendents and administrators and highly effective teachers in schools and districts. This acknowledgement of excellence follows on other national rankings and recognitions received by the college, including:</p><ul><li>No. 1 in the country for <a href=\"https://www.collegechoice.net/rankings/best-online-masters-in-curriculum-and-instruction/\">Online Master&apos;s Degrees in Curriculum and Instruction</a> by College Choice.</li><li>No. 5 nationally and the top in Texas for <a href=\"https://www.intelligent.com/best-online-masters-in-education/\">Best Master&#x2019;s in Education Online</a> in 2018 by Intelligent.com.</li><li>No. 5 in the nation and second in Texas for <a href=\"https://www.collegechoice.net/rankings/elementary-education-degrees/\">Elementary Education Degree</a> in 2018 by College Choice.</li><li>No. 46 and tied for fourth in Texas for <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/education/online-education/education/rankings\">Best Online Graduate Education Programs</a> by U.S. News &amp; World Report.</li></ul><p>UTA has also partnered with area school districts, including Arlington Independent School District and Grand Prairie Independent School District, on an innovative Teaching Academy program to encourage high school students to pursue careers in teaching and provide them clear paths to success. The Teacher Academy provides high school juniors and seniors from Arlington and Grand Prairie the opportunity to earn both university semester credit hours and high school course credit, giving students primed for a teaching career an advantage as they become college and workforce ready.</p><p>&#x201C;At the Arlington ISD, we seek to hire the best teachers,&#x201D; said AISD Superintendent Dr. Marcelo Cavazos. &#x201C;Many of our teachers receive their education from UTA and then join the district. We know when we hire teachers from the UTA program, they are well-trained to take on the everyday challenges of leading our students to success.&#x201D;</p><p>Students pursue one of four study pathways: bilingual education, English as a second language, early childhood through sixth grade and special education. Students sign a degree plan with UTA as high school juniors and, through dual-credit offerings, are able to complete their college degree within three years of graduating from high school. Once they complete the program and earn teaching certifications, they become preferred candidates for teaching positions.</p><p>In addition to preparing teachers, UTA offers coursework and internships leading to certification for principals and superintendents through the Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies.</p>"

But Zhou is investigating the theory that ALS affects the physiology of the whole body through defective cells in multiple organs.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;Twelve years ago, my lab made a discovery in the muscle defects of ALS, and we have been looking closely at the disease ever since,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;In the beginning, we believed the muscle atrophy ALS causes was secondary to the death of the neurons in the spinal cord, but we have evidence that indicates the muscle is not only a victim of the disease, rather it actively contributes to it. This is a systemic disorder affecting the whole body.&#x201D;</p><p>A respected leader in her field, Zhou has published more than 70 peer-reviewed articles and received more than $4 million in grants in the last decade. She recently received a $2.88 million award from the National Institutes of Health and was invited to serve as a member of the NIH Center for Scientific Review&#x2019;s Skeletal Muscle and Exercise Physiology Study Section.</p><p>The NIH grant supports Zhou&#x2019;s work to preserve mitochondria as it functions or dysfunctions in a diseased cell&#x2014;part of her pursuit to understand the mechanisms behind why multiple organs are involved in ALS deterioration.</p><p>&#x201C;We are ultimately working to find some potential therapeutic means to treat the disease with a new understanding,&#x201D; Zhou said. &#x201C;Once we understand why the cells are damaged, we can test potential compounds or therapies.&#x201D;</p><p>The NIH-funded study is the continuation of a project Zhou started with funding from the ALS Association. Zhou&#x2019;s was one of 58 labs selected to receive grants funded by donations raised in 2014 through the viral ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.</p><p>Since Zhou began her work on ALS, she has heard countless stories of how the disease has impacted patients and their families. These personal stories, she says, motivate her to keep going.</p><p>Paul Fadel, CONHI&#x2019;s associate dean for research, said Zhou&#x2019;s expertise fortifies the College&#x2019;s reputation as an innovative center for research and advances UTA&#x2019;s pursuit of being a leader in serving <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Zhou&#x2019;s research explores new territories in an effort to bring relief to ALS patients and their families,&#x201D; Fadel said. &#x201C;Her work is groundbreaking, and she plays an essential role in the growth and leadership of the Bone-Muscle Research Center. She is a renowned expert in the field and an enthusiastic collaborator that strengthens our faculty and student experience. We are fortunate to have Dr. Zhou on our team at UTA.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou came to UTA in July 2018 as associate director of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/research/bmrc/index.php\">Bone-Muscle Research Center</a>.&#xA0; Zhou said she was attracted to UTA because of the opportunity for collaborative research the new Science &amp; Engineering Innovation &amp; Research Building provides.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption250\"><img alt id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/jingsong-zhou-lab-action.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>&#x201C;I was looking for a big stage, a big scientific environment, and that&#x2019;s what UTA offered,&#x201D; Zhou said. &#x201C;The SEIR Building and collaboration through our Bone-Muscle Research Center helps us be more competitive for funding. That allows us to do better science, make a stronger impact on the research field and provide significant benefits for our society.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhou&#x2019;s work in examining mitochondria in diseased cells in cases of ALS has translated to other areas of medical research. In February, she was awarded a $610,000 grant from the NIH to apply the concept to the heart muscle in cases of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>&#x201C;When you look at cells through a microscope, it&#x2019;s the same as looking through a telescope at the universe&#x2014;the discoveries are infinite,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s extremely important to take our time to explore and understand as many elements of the disease as possible so we can fight it efficiently.&#x201D;</p><p>&#xA0;</p>"

ROS help kill toxins in the body, but can also be damaging to cells if they reach a critical level.</p><p>TiO<sub>2</sub> enters cells and produces ROS, which are able to damage plasma membranes, mitochondria and DNA, causing cell death.</p><p>&#x201C;Cancer cells are characterized by a higher steady-state saturation of ROS than normal, healthy cells,&#x201D; Chen said. &#x201C;This new therapy allows us to exploit that by raising the saturation of ROS in cancer cells to a critical level that triggers cell death without pushing the normal cells to that same threshold.&#x201D;</p><p>The pilot study for this new treatment concept builds upon Chen&#x2019;s expertise in the use of <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2018/10/Wei-Chen-cancer-patent.php\">nanoparticles to combat cancer</a>.</p><p>Chen&#x2019;s collaborators hail from the Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences and Beihang University. The team conducted experiments that demonstrate the nanoparticles can significantly suppress the growth of osteosarcomas under microwave irradiation.</p><p>While TiO<sub>2</sub> and low-power microwave irradiation alone did not effectively kill cancer cells, the combination of the two proved successful in creating a toxic effect for the tumor cells. Microwave ablation therapy has already proven to be an effective treatment against bone cancer, obtaining better results than MDT. However, MDT has applications for combatting other types of cancer, not just the osteosarcomas used for this pilot case.</p><p>Using light to activate ROS&#x2014;as is seen in photodynamic therapy&#x2014;can be challenging for the treatment of tumors deeply located within the body; in contrast, microwaves lend the ability to create deeper penetration that propagates through all types of tissues and non-metallic materials.</p><p>&#x201C;This new discovery is exciting because it potentially creates new avenues for treating cancer patients without causing debilitating side effects,&#x201D; Chen said. &#x201C;This targeted, localized method allows us to keep healthy cells intact so patients are better equipped to battle the disease.&#x201D;</p><p>The results of the pilot study indicate MDT is a promising approach for cancer treatment even though the method is still being developed and its limitations explored. The research team has filed a patent for MDT. Next, they plan to turn their attention to understanding the physics and internal mechanisms behind the powerful combination of microwaves and TiO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Chen continues to build a research portfolio that holds transformative implications for cancer treatment,&#x201D; said Alex Weiss, chair of UTA&#x2019;s Department of Physics. &#x201C;This new work is exemplary of the spirit of discovery we strive to embody at UTA. I look forward to what Dr. Chen and his collaborators can accomplish in the coming phases of this research as they pioneer a potential new avenue for combatting cancer.&#x201D;</p>"

But they have recently experienced massive declines driven by disease and thermally induced mass coral bleaching in the face of increased environmental disturbances.</p><p>&#x201C;Corals build the reef and are the base of the ecosystem,&#x201D; Mydlarz said. &#x201C;Without live coral, the reef doesn&#x2019;t have the structure it needs to support the life that relies on it. It&#x2019;s ecologically important, but also has great socioeconomic significance. Understanding the existence of this gene means that there is now the potential to identify if corals are experiencing stress before they appear dead or bleached.&#x201D;</p><p>Dimos said the ability to predict coral survival will help scientists and conservationists allocate resources and determine which species to prioritize as the environment increasingly becomes more unstable.</p><p>Clay Clark, chair of the Department of Biology, said the work of Dimos, Mydlarz and Pellegrino is making significant contributions to UTA&#x2019;s commitment to address critical issues related to the <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/impact.php\">global environment</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;It is exciting to see two labs combine their strengths and resources to tackle a major issue with numerous critical implications,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;Bradford, Laura and Mark are showcasing the power of research as they move swiftly and thoroughly in response to a rapidly growing issue. I look forward to how this breakthrough will lead them to protect these vital organisms to secure invaluable biodiversity.&#x201D;</p>"

He said his instrument can analyze and present results on a single drop of liquid while flying through or by the atmospheres of other planets and moons.</p><p>&#x201C;There are fundamental incompatibilities between how one measures key ions in an Earth-bound lab and what NASA needs us to do in space,&#x201D; Dasgupta said. &#x201C;We had to devise a method to detect and separate ions that uses very little power and does not take up too much space. Every little bit of weight, volume and power is expensive when traveling to another planet.&#x201D;</p><p>The project was supported by almost $1 million from NASA through a Planetary Instrument Concepts for the Advancement of Solar System Observations, or PICASSO, grant. Dasgupta has received an additional $1.4 million Maturation of Instruments for Solar System Exploration, or MatISSE, grant from NASA to continue to strengthen the instrumentation and prove it can withstand the harsh conditions and lengthy travel times of space exploration.</p><p>&#x201C;The MatISSE phase focuses more on engineering and proving the robustness of the equipment and is less about the possibility of new discovery than in the PICASSO stage,&#x201D; Dasgupta said. &#x201C;But it is vital nonetheless. We have to ensure the instrument can reach a site after a journey of several months or years and still perform if we want it to take up a valuable spot on a spacecraft.&#x201D;</p><p>While there is an immediate focus on Mars for exploration, Dasgupta said the open-tubular chromatograph has the potential for analysis at sites that require five or more years of travel to reach.</p><p>Morteza Khaledi, dean of the UTA College of Science, said Dasgupta&#x2019;s ability to develop technology that withstands the hostile environments of space is an impressive feat.</p><p>&#x201C;To miniaturize the open-tubular chromatography system to this extent, Sandy had to devise innovative engineering and analytical techniques that not only have potential for important discoveries outside of our planet, but also implications for revolutionizing the way we conduct this kind of science on Earth,&#x201D; Khaledi said. &#x201C;I applaud Sandy for the way he reaches across boundaries to answer questions and thank him for his visionary work.&#x201D;</p><p>Dasgupta&#x2019;s research portfolio showcases his expertise in chromatography and his ability to solve complex problems, said Duane Dimos, vice president for research.</p><p>&#x201C;Sandy&#x2019;s research is innately purpose- and outcome-driven,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;UTA has a distinguished history of working with NASA, and Sandy is continuing that tradition by creating a vital tool that can help answer one of our greatest longstanding questions. He and his team of students represent a unique way of multidisciplinary thinking to overcome obstacles. I am grateful to see them contribute mightily to NASA&#x2019;s mission while enhancing scholarship at UTA.&#x201D;</p><p>Dasgupta has received numerous national and international honors for his work in recent years, like earning the <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/08/Dasgupta%20Talanta%20Award.php\">Talanta Medal</a> and being named to the <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/11/Dasgupta%20Armstrong%20release.php\">Power List by The Analytical Scientist Magazine</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2018/02/dasgupta-texas-distinguished-scientist-acs-instrumentation-awards.php\">was selected</a> as the 2018 Distinguished Texas Scientist by the Texas Academy of Science and the recipient of the 2018 American Chemical Society&#x2019;s Division of Analytical Chemistry Chemical Instrumentation Award.</p><p>Recently, one of his papers was identified as one of the 10 <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2019/03/Dasgupta-Analytical-Scientist-mention.php\">most influential papers</a> published in 2018. This is the second consecutive year he has received this honor.</p><p>Dasgupta said his achievements would not be possible without the UTA students who work in his lab and pursue their own problem-solving research. He said he is fortunate his peers recognize his work.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m thrilled that I&#x2019;ve been able to spend most of my life playing in laboratories and answering questions,&#x201D; Dasgupta said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m grateful people have found enough meaning in that to fund my work and allow me to keep playing.

It will immediately be put to use for research funded by $1.5 million in grants from the Office of Naval Research to develop advanced laser-based measurements of plasma flow for the study of heat shields for hypersonic vehicles,</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;d like to congratulate Professor Maddalena and his team on reaching this milestone,&#x201D; UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said. &#x201C;This facility will enable pioneering research to be conducted in support of national priorities in hypersonics and plasma flows stretching the boundaries of knowledge in the fields of aerodynamics and materials, and I&#x2019;m thrilled to see us continue to build on the work of Professors Wilson and Lu, maintaining our position as a national leader in this area.&#x201D;</p><p>The wind tunnel, dubbed &#x201C;Leste&#x201D; after hot winds in the Canary Islands, was designed and built with a $1.01 million Defense University Research Instrumentation Program, or DURIP, grant, as well as substantial funds provided by UTA.</p><p>An additional $690,000 DURIP grant was awarded in early 2019 to purchase a femtosecond laser system, which will be the only one of its kind to be used in an arc-heated wind tunnel in the United States. A femtosecond is one quadrillionth, or one millionth of a billionth, of a second. An $818,000 grant was also awarded to develop the laser system and characterize the arc-jet flow.</p><p>Because the wind tunnel is unique, Maddalena and his students had to design nearly all of its parts, then run computer simulations to ensure that they would function as expected. A greater challenge was finding manufacturers to produce the heavy components because of the extreme conditions they must withstand. He also had to find a company to build the facility, eventually hiring APS Industrial Service Inc.</p><p>Maddalena&#x2019;s team included post-doctoral researchers Stefano Gulli, Fabrizio Vergine and Davide Vigano; doctoral students Vijay Gopal and Daniel Palmquist; master&#x2019;s graduate David Campbell; undergraduate students Cooper Green, Ian Raybon, Rachel Weeresinghe and Skyla Westphal; and lab manager David Carter.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Luca Maddalena\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/luca-maddalena-wind-tunnel.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Luca Maddalena</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m very proud of my students, who helped every step of the way,&#x201D; Maddalena said. &#x201C;No one was on the team just to pass around a screwdriver or a hammer. They performed real research and were instrumental in the successful launch of this new tunnel.&#x201D;</p><p>The wind tunnel is housed in UTA&#x2019;s Aerodynamics Research Center, which also boasts low-speed, transonic and supersonic wind tunnels and a hypersonic shock tunnel.</p><p>When hypersonic vehicles cruise through the atmosphere at 3,500 miles per hour or faster, friction causes them to heat up to more than 8,000 degrees Kelvin, or about 15,000 degrees Fahrenheit. At these temperatures, superheated air, or plasma, flows around the vehicle and evolves as it does so, making it necessary for engineers to calculate simultaneously its chemistry and fluid dynamics to develop an effective heat shield.</p><p>Current models are not able to accurately predict what will happen in every situation, so Maddalena and his team will use a research grant from the Office of Naval Research to develop diagnostic techniques to characterize the plasma flow, thereby improving the understanding of the relationship between arc-jet test and flight environments.</p><p>&#x201C;It generally takes about 10 years to develop a new heat shield for a hypersonic vehicle, and part of it is due to the uncertainties associated with the arc-jet plasma flow,&#x201D; Maddalena said. &#x201C;In other words, you don&#x2019;t know at what exact conditions you&#x2019;re testing.&#x201D;</p><p>For the Navy&#x2019;s specific applications, air density and skin friction on the hypersonic vehicle come into play, which can drastically change the performance of the thermal protection system. According to Maddalena, UTA is the only U.S. university with the ability to reproduce significant skin friction with its facility.</p><p>&#x201C;The Office of Naval Research is proud to be associated with the only arc-jet facility based at a university in the United States,&#x201D; said Eric Wuchina, program officer with the Office of Naval Research. &#x201C;This facility will allow researchers to develop a deeper understanding of the boundary-layer chemistry and physics under simulated flight conditions of high shear and high enthalpy flows.&#xA0;This will provide valuable data for the aerothermodynamics community and help materials scientists understand the thermochemical response of thermal protection materials in hypersonic flight conditions.&#x201D;</p><p>Since the flow in the wind tunnel will be heated beyond temperatures that an un-cooled physical measurement device could survive, Maddalena and his team will use the femtosecond laser system to capture the temperature and composition of the plasma flow. The laser system is so advanced that it has never been used in an arc-jet facility and is still being built.</p><p>&#x201C;Thanks to Dr. Maddalena and the successful birth of his brainchild, &#x2018;Leste,&#x2019; UTA will significantly contribute to development of a qualified workforce in hypersonics&#x2014;a critical need to our national security,&#x201D; said Erian Armanios, chair of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. &#x201C;From the foundations laid over time by such leaders and researchers as Dr. Don Wilson and Dr. Frank Lu, Dr. Maddalena has built a unique capability that will allow us to reach new frontiers in fundamental and applied research.&#x201D;</p><p>Maddalena&#x2019;s research continues UTA&#x2019;s long history of leadership in aerodynamics and is an example of data-driven discovery, one of the four themes of the University&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020</a>, said UTA engineering Dean Peter Crouch.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Maddalena&#x2019;s success in designing, building and launching the only university-based arc-heated hypersonic wind tunnel in the United States is a critical step forward in UTA&#x2019;s leading role in developing fundamental understanding that is critical to U.S. leadership in the field,&#x201D; Crouch said.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>"

The Lady Movin&#x2019; Mavs started play in 2013. Since then, the team has earned two national championships.</p><p>&#x201C;Team USA does a great job at identifying talent, and that talent falls squarely here at UTA,&#x201D; Garner said. &#x201C;Tournaments like this and the Paralympics provide a next step for these world-class athletes and on their journeys.&#x201D;</p><p>Team USA was dominant in the tournament.

So did Lindsay, who also was the tournament&#x2019;s top scorer with 110 points. Hollermann was named Most Valuable Player.</p><p>Apart from its status as a destination university for adaptive athletes, UTA is one of the nation&#x2019;s leading institutions providing students with disabilities access to high quality educational opportunities. UTA was the first university in the nation to offer full-ride scholarships for athletes in adapted sports. UTA&#x2019;s disability studies minor was the first such program in the south and is one of only about 30 in the nation.</p><p>Wheelchair basketball became a sport at UTA in 1976 as a recreational event for students with disabilities. On the men&#x2019;s side, it became a recognized intercollegiate athletic program in 1988, with intercollegiate play beginning the following year. The Movin&#x2019; Mavs have won eight collegiate championships.</p><p>In 2019, the Lady Movin&#x2019; Mavs fell just short of back-to-back national championships, losing 82-76 in overtime to Alabama in March.</p>"

He won the American Geophysical Union&#x2019;s 2016 Space Physics and Aeronomy Richard Carrington Award, which honors recipients&#x2019; significant impact on the understanding of science by students and the public. He was the 2012 winner of the APS Edward A.

He triple taps the screen of his cellphone to magnify every interface. And he relies on a team of UTA students to handle the micro-level, precise movements his research requires.</p><p>All these adaptations help ensure that Varanasi&#x2019;s progressive vision loss, caused by a genetic retinal disorder, doesn&#x2019;t inhibit research that could revolutionize bone treatments for severe cranial injuries. His projects in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/research/bmrc/index.php\">Bone-Muscle Research Center</a>, he says, are too important to let declining vision hamper his work.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/venu-varanasi.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Venu Varanasi is an associate professor of nursing at UTA and holds a dual appointment in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>&#x201C;We have the potential to change the way we deliver health care,&#x201D; Varanasi said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re moving past current methods of cutting and patching patients and building a transformative method that will heal them without invasive techniques.</p><p>&#x201C;Health care is on the cusp of a new era driven by innovations, affordability and accessibility, and our research can put UTA at the forefront of that movement.&#x201D;</p><p>Severe cranium injuries often have difficulty healing, in part due to the large size of the missing bone. Metal or plastic implants, meanwhile, can take a long time to be tailored to fit and support bone fixation. That can lead to more surgeries, if the injury does not heal properly.</p><p>Varanasi has developed a method for live 3D printing of bone-forming scaffolds in the cranium that are grafted to bone defects in real-time. This non-invasive approach would lead to shorter healing times and be more in tune with the body&#x2019;s natural healing process.</p><p>Marco Brotto, the George W. and Hazel M. Jay Professor in CONHI, said Varanasi&#x2019;s work marks a bold, new approach to the treatment of musculoskeletal maladies, which cost the health care systems worldwide about $1 trillion annually.</p><p>&#x201C;Venu&#x2019;s work captures the meaning of translational research and has tremendous commercialization potential,&#x201D; said Brotto, who leads the Bone-Muscle Research Center. &#x201C;Implants for cranial defects require continued care and medical attention, which leads to high costs for the patient. Venu&#x2019;s research could bring about a new family of devices that promote self-healing, which not only is the best way for a patient to heal, but also leads to increased accessibility of treatment.</p><p>&#x201C;Venu&#x2019;s challenges have pushed him to pursue work that helps and heals people, and we are fortunate he brought that passion to our university.&#x201D;</p><p>With Varanasi&#x2019;s method, nurses and physical therapists could act as &#x201C;tissue engineers&#x201D; within clinical settings, providing UTA nursing students with a new, marketable skillset that positions them on the leading edge of health care technology.</p><p>&#x201C;Our college name includes &#x2018;Health Innovation&#x2019; for a reason, and our students deserve to be seen in the same light as the standard-bearers of the medical field,&#x201D; Varanasi said. &#x201C;This new technique would give patients the help they need without feeling like they have to seek out top surgeons.&#x201D;</p><p>Accessibility has been a focus of Varanasi&#x2019;s life since he was a child, when the effects of a genetic retinal disorder called Stargardt disease slowly robbed him of his vision. The condition has left him almost completely unable to read anything on paper, Varanasi said, although he has a fighting chance if something is printed in bold and greater than 32-point font size. In addition, blind spots in his central vision skew his perception of objects and colors around him.</p><p>His eyesight first began to affect his career as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California at San Francisco, when he received a prestigious National Institutes of Health Early Career Development Program grant on his first attempt. It was a pivotal moment in Varanasi&#x2019;s budding career, but poor vision left him unable to perform the precise microscopic measurements that his work demanded.</p><p>While he could have chosen a different path, he said he was inspired by his mentors at UCSF and chose to adapt. Instead of giving up on his research, he mentored students to continue the work he could no longer do on his own, a strategy he brought to UTA.</p><p>&#x201C;There is an inherently collaborative atmosphere in Dr. Varanasi&#x2019;s lab,&#x201D; said Neelam Ahuja, a doctoral student who works as Varanasi&#x2019;s faculty associate. &#x201C;He empowers us to be equal players in the research.&#x201D;</p><p>With his vision continually deteriorating, Varanasi said he had concerns about being able to remain in academia. Those concerns dissipated when he came to UTA in 2018 and met with the University&#x2019;s leaders.</p><p>&#x201C;UTA is poised to be a scientific anchor in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex as a significant university with comprehensive opportunities for undergraduate through postdoctoral students,&#x201D; Varanasi said. &#x201C;We can be that both because of our location and our dedication to be accessible to everybody. Leaders at UTA recognize that the more accessible we are to people with disabilities or physical limitations, the better opportunity we&#x2019;ll have to wholly educate the next generation of scientists and workforce leaders.&#x201D;</p>"

No one else was injured.</p><p>Fox has experienced a lot in his 30-plus years as a professional photojournalist&#x2014;but nothing like what happened that Monday morning.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption200\"><img alt=\"Tom Fox\" id=\"story-image-5\" src=\"/news/images/tom-fox-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Tom Fox, UTA alumnus and photographer with The Dallas Morning News</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>&#x201C;In some ways, it&#x2019;s harder to witness other people&#x2019;s agony than your own,&#x201D; said Fox, who was part of The Dallas Morning News photography team that won the Pulitzer Prize for their Hurricane Katrina coverage. &#x201C;When you see the devastation floodwaters have on a person, or a family or someone being airlifted from a flood site and they know they&#x2019;ll never come back, that&#x2019;s tough.&#x201D;</p><p>Fox is one of many notable UTA alumni who hold key positions at media outlets across the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and nationwide, including the Morning News, Fort Worth Star-Telegram, The Washington Post and others.
