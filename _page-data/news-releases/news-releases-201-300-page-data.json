They have shown that using infrared light to stimulate sections of the human forehead can enhance blood flow and efficiency of oxygen usage in the frontal cortex, leading to improvement of memory and cognition in normal aging and in patients with brain injuries or disease. Based on what they have learned in past studies, the research team plans to develop a thorough understanding of the mechanism of TIBS using imaging tools and see how brain networks work together and can be modified for their best efficiency.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Many behavioral studies by other groups have shown improvement of cognitive functions in stroke victims and those who suffer from depression or mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease,&#x201D; Liu said. &#x201C;But we will be the first to map brain networks with relation to TIBS.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m really grateful for this grant. It will put UTA on the map as a leader in this cutting-edge, dual-mode (brain stimulation and imaging together) processing technology. Our unique team, and our unique resources, are very important to our success.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The brain is a large organization of networks that control motor functions, cognition and behavior. If connections are broken in one or more places in these networks, it will create neurological dysfunction. TIBS can be used to non-invasively and effectively reconnect or enhance those broken connections, like fixing a short circuit in an electrical connection, leading to a lessening of the effects of certain neurological diseases.</p>\n<p>The research team will conduct their multi-site studies at three UT Arlington, UT Austin and UT Southwestern with whole-head optical imaging and 64-channel electroencephalogram or EEG measurement to see the effects of TIBS on brain waves and blood flow in brain networks before, during and after stimulation. They will also map how networks communicate with each other and determine how they are connected for particular functions.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA, Yale and Princeton are the only universities in the United States that have the type of dual-mode facility necessary for this research, according to Liu. The University&#x2019;s Shimadzu Institute for Research Technologies has a 133-channel optical brain imager and a 64-channel EEG machine which the team will use in the course of their work.</p>\n<p>The Shimadzu Institute is a centralized research resource that provides access to instrumentation and expertise in support of research in biochemistry, biology, chemistry, cognition, engineering, geoscience, materials science, nanotechnology and neuroscience. The Institute was established in 2013 as a result of the partnership between UTA and the Shimadzu Corp.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;With this facility, we can study neurovascular coupling at the network level,&#x201D; Liu said.&#xA0; &#x201C;We will be able to see the interaction between neurons and blood flow across the entire human cortex and how the interactions change under this non-invasive brain stimulation.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Fenghua Tian\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/fenghua-tian.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Fenghua Tian, a UTA&#xA0;research assistant professor in bioengineering, will use an NIH two-year, $420,000 grant to build upon previous research and begin an exploratory clinical trial to understand the physiological effects of the TIBS treatment on a patient&#x2019;s brain.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>In a related research project, Fenghua Tian, a research assistant professor in UTA&#x2019;s Bioengineering Department, will use a two-year, R61 grant from the National Institutes of Health to build upon Liu and Gonzalez-Lima&#x2019;s previous research and begin an exploratory clinical trial to understand the physiological effects of transcranial infrared laser stimulation&#xA0;intervention on a patient&#x2019;s brain.</p>\n<p>Liu, UTA Psychology Professor Robert Gatchel, Gonzalez-Lima and Martin Woon from UT Austin, and UT Southwestern Psychiatrist Carol North are collaborating with Tian.</p>\n<p>Tian is recruiting 20 veterans for this trial. Interventions will be once a week for seven weeks and will take just eight minutes to complete each time. He will use optimal brain imaging technologies developed by his collaborators to measure changes in cerebral blood flow and oxygenation before, during and after every interventon. If this trial shows convincing results, the research is expected to continue for another three years with 40 subjects.</p>\n<p>Using near-infrared lasers is a preferable intervention for many because it is safe, painless, non-invasive and does not require the subject to ingest a drug. No side-effects have been found.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Seeing local veterans who come back to UTA from various battlefields and then struggle to study and learn drives our research. We are trying to understand the underlying problems that cause these veterans&#x2019; cognitive issues so that we can refine what has proved to be an effective, non-invasive intervention that might help them to better adjust to civilian life and their studies,&#x201D; Tian said.</p>\n<p>Research in both projects is an example of the groundbreaking work in&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a>, key tenets of UTA&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Michael Cho, UTA&#x2019;s bioengineering department chair.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The brain is a vastly complicated organ, and we are far from a complete understanding of how it works. Through Dr. Liu&#x2019;s and Dr. Tian&#x2019;s projects, we are making strides toward treating brain injuries and disease that will greatly affect large segments of our population in the future,&#x201D; said Cho, who also is the Alfred R. and Janet H.

His project would then develop techniques to tap into that data and allow third-party clients to leverage the technology to develop location-based services applications for the public.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Location-based services give us a wealth of information for analyzing data, but the problem is who has the data: you as the user know your own and maybe some of your friends&#x2019;, but service providers are the only ones who have all of the data and can do global analytics,&#x201D; Das said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re asking, as an end user or third-party service who can only access this data in a limited manner, what kind of analysis can we do, and how can we use this information?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Das hopes to use tools such as random sampling to perform analytics on the data obtained through existing rules for accessing data. Each company provides a specific set of rules called an application program interface, or API, that provides protocols for how to access the data. The research will develop analytics tools that carefully follow those protocols, which can be used by third party applications.</p>\n<p>However, service providers could view this as snooping or a threat to their business secrets and are likely to be wary of allowing access. Das&#x2019; challenge is to find a way to use the API to access the data and serve customers while preventing probes that would be harmful to the company.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If it works, it offers a lot of opportunities for third-party providers to build apps and take advantage of the data. It also could expose chinks in the API models, and we will alert companies to sophisticated algorithms that are out there already trying to exploit them,&#x201D; Das said. &#x201C;Regardless of the positives, there will always be a point at which the providers will balk, and we will try to find that point and work within those parameters.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Location-based data could show the number of cars on a particular route that third-party vendors could use for market research or to offer services to those drivers. The data also could be valuable for security or defense purposes because the U.S. could use the data to get an idea of traffic in certain areas that could be connected to world events.</p>\n<p>EAGER grants are awarded to researchers who propose potentially transformative research into high-risk, high-reward new subjects or methods that lead to innovation.</p>\n<p>Das&#x2019; research is an example of innovative thinking in the area of <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a>, one of the themes of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Hong Jiang, Wendell Nedderman Chair and Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The analysis of big data across all spectrums is a constantly changing challenge, and Dr. Das&#x2019; work offers an interesting juxtaposition between the scientific and social norms surrounding it,&#x201D; Jiang said. &#x201C;There are great challenges in protecting companies&#x2019; trade secrets while still making data available for commercial purposes, and if he is successful it could change how social media data is used.&#x201D;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

The year-to-date crime rate at UTA is down 32 percent from 2014.</p>\n<p>While The University of Texas at Arlington is located in the middle of one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country, the UTA Police Department employs proactive measures to ensure this is a safe and secure campus. UTAPD has hired 12 police officers and 12 public safety officers since the Fall 2016 semester.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our police officers are the best in their field and exhibit tremendous dedication to our campus community every day,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;The safety of students, faculty, staff and visitors is our number one priority and we have invested in technology and training to provide a secure and welcoming environment for them.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTAPD, named the UT System&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2016/10/Pacesetter-UTSystem-award-police.php\">Pacesetter Police Department of the Year</a>&#xA0;in 2016, enhanced its technological capabilities by strategically placing equipment at parking facilities and remote areas of campus.</p>\n<p>The department also launched MavWatch, a program that places students on patrol. UTAPD trained several students, two of whom will act as supervisors, to provide additional eyes and ears across campus. These are part-time paid student-worker positions.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://police.uta.edu/services/mavwatch.php\">MavWatch</a>&#xA0;Patrol Officers will function not as police officers, but as a support team to patrol campus for unusual activity, provide courtesy escorts, assist visitors and report safety concerns for expeditious resolution.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;MavWatch student patrols will immediately report to our officers anything that seems suspicious so that we can respond,&#x201D; said UTA Police Chief Kim Lemaux. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s crucial that our community looks out for one another. That&#x2019;s why we are excited to introduce the MavWatch program. We believe it adds an extra layer of observance and establishes an even closer connection between those of us in uniform and the community we serve.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Lemaux said partnerships across campus are key to lowering crime. After consulting with UTAPD, the Central Library developed new entrance and exit procedures and the Maverick Activities Center instituted new locker policies that have lowered the instances of theft of personal property at both locations.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our police department is a true leader in campus policing,&#x201D; said Vice President for Administration and Campus Operations John Hall. &#x201C;Texas Governor Greg Abbott appointed Chief Lemaux to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement, which establishes and enforces standards for the state&#x2019;s law enforcement, corrections and public safety telecommunications personnel. UTA&#x2019;s Police Department has also been reaccredited by the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators and the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. We are in good hands at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b>Important numbers for students, faculty and staff:</b></p>\n<p>UTA PD Emergency: 817-272-3003 or 911&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA PD Non-Emergency: 817-272-3381</p>\n<p>Mavs Courtesy Escort: 817-272-5252, or use any blue call box on campus</p>\n<p>For more information about services provided by UTA PD, visit&#xA0;<a href=\"http://police.uta.edu/\">police.uta.edu</a>.

Only after Kim assured her that she would thrive did she have the courage to change her major to music.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Every semester, Raehann rose to a higher level of singer,&#x201D; Kim said. &#x201C;The most wonderful aspect of her talent as a performer, as she learned to control her voice in a classical way, was her stage presentation. She was fearless.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Raehann practiced relentlessly every day. &#x201C;I believe it is the fruit of that effort that she now enjoys,&#x201D; Kim said.</p>\n<p>Bryce-Davis just finished her first year as an ensemble member at Opera Vlaanderen in Antwerp/Ghent, Belgium. &#x201C;In retrospect, it was quite bold of Dr. Kim to swear to a student that she could make it in this bizarre industry,&#x201D; she said.&#xA0; &#x201C;I am thankful she did, because I wouldn&#x2019;t be here otherwise.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Since graduating from UTA in 2010 and earning a master of music degree from the Manhattan School of Music in 2012, Bryce-Davis has performed ensemble opera roles in hundreds of opera performances, been highlighted as a soloist nearly a dozen times with notable orchestras, and garnered international critical acclaim.</p>\n<p>Her win at the event hosted by the City of Portofino will be added to her long list of accomplishments such as Grand Prize and Audience Prize winner of the Hilde Zadek Competition at the Musikverein in Vienna in 2015 and winner of the 2015 Merola Opera Program Career Grant.&#xA0; Bryce-Davis has also won four other professional voice competitions in her young career.</p>\n<p>This fall, Bryce-Davis will sing Wellgunde in Wagner&#x2019;s <i>Ring Cycle</i> at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna. In the spring of 2018 she will make her Carnegie Hall debut as the mezzo soloist in the world premiere of <i>Sanctuary Road</i> by Paul Moravec with the Oratorio Society, conducted by Kent Tritle.&#xA0; She will also make a concert debut at the Vienna Musikverein singing &#x201C;Sea Pictures&#x201D; with the Tonkunstler Orchestra.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>--Written by Tish Williamson</em></p>\n"

        "body": "\n<p>Acculturation may play a key role in psychological birth trauma among young Latina mothers, according to a study by a researcher at the University of Texas at Arlington&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/cheryl-anderson.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Cheryl Anderson, UTA associate professor of nursing</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>But the relationship between psychological birth trauma and acculturation, a process in which one culture overshadows another, among Hispanic adolescent mothers is largely unexplored and that needs to change in light of the state&#x2019;s rapidly changing racial and ethnic demographics, said Cheryl Anderson, a UTA associate professor of nursing. Psychological birth trauma is a form of mental or emotional distress suffered by some mothers following childbirth.</p>\n<p>In the study, which was published in the July edition of the journal Hispanic Health Care International, Anderson observed a sample of 66 Hispanic females between 13 and 19. Most of them were either first or second generation Americans. Anderson noted that lack of support and depression have been associated with psychological birth trauma for both adolescents and adults. Age has also been associated with higher risks for PTSD<b><i>.</i></b>&#xA0;Compared to some other ethnic groups, young Latinas are more likely to have some form of support from other women, particularly during childbirth. Anderson believes that for this reason, there may be additional factors that contribute to psychological trauma in this population.</p>\n<p>But given the relatively large number of births by younger Latinas, Anderson said, more research needs to be done to determine if acculturation is a risk factor than contributes to a more traumatic birth experience.</p>\n<p>The article was co-written by Sarah Strickland, a registered nurse who served as Anderson&#x2019;s graduate assistant.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Hispanics, the largest ethnic group in the United States, make up approximately 15 percent of the population. More than half of them reside in Florida, California or Texas and about half of married Hispanic households in the United States include children who are 18 or younger, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In general, birthrates for young Latinas are higher than that of any other group: 38 out of 1000 compared to 23 in 1000 for the rest of the population. But no research exists on the link between acculturation and psychological birth trauma, said Anderson.</p>\n<p>Anderson&#x2019;s study is an example of UTA&#x2019;s commitment to conducting high impact research and developing diagnostic, prognostic and technological advancements that will help people live longer, healthier and happier lives.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s less literature on childbearing minorities than on whites. It&#x2019;s imperative for us as Texans to know that,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;We have a high population of Hispanics. This has practice implications for healthcare providers in this state, especially those in border towns with higher Hispanic populations. We need to have more research that looks at acculturation as it relates to the birth experience.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, called the study an important building block in tackling health issues among some ethnic groups. Health and the Human Condition is one of the four pillars of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/\">2020 Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We can&#x2019;t have a healthy, vibrant state or nation if the health care needs of a significant percentage of our population are not thoroughly understood,&#x201D; said Bavier. &#x201C;Cheryl has spent nearly a decade studying birth trauma and PTSD among young birth mothers. But this study is particularly remarkable because it views this subject through the acculturation lens.&#x201D;</p>\n"

This represents a 12 percent increase as compared to fall semester last year.</p>\n<p>The new class is also the most academically accomplished, with 65 percent of entering freshmen having graduated in the top 25 percent of their high school class. A record 261 new students have been accepted to UTA&#x2019;s Honors College, an increase of more than 60 percent over the year before. The average SAT score of incoming students has also risen.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s growing reputation as a leading academic university and path to success has resulted in more high achieving and highly motivated students choosing us,&#x201D; said Troy Johnson, UTA vice president for enrollment management.&#x201D; The overall academic excellence of the entire freshman class is an important indicator that UTA is a rising star.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Entering freshman and Timberview High School valedictorian Hana Bader Ali plans to major in biochemistry and become a doctor.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The vast and growing array of research and academic opportunities that UTA has to offer attracted me and I knew UTA was the perfect place for me to receive my education and thrive,&#x201D; Ali said. &#x201C;In the future, I want to help those in my community get the care they need and even join an organization like Doctors without Borders to help those in crises around the world.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Her classmate and Pinkston High School valedictorian Julio Nunez plans to major in electrical engineering and move into project management as soon as he establishes himself as an experienced professional.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As an electrical engineer from UTA, my career paths will be vast,&#x201D; Nunez said. &#x201C;The diversity element is also unmatched here and give me the satisfaction of feeling welcome, while still meeting new people and learning about their cultures.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Richland High School salutatorian Brittany Lane Baskett added that she received very positive guidance about UTA from former college graduates. &#x201C;My friends encouraged me to choose UTA because I wanted to attend the type of university that offers a great education, but with an affordable tuition,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/ladders-labs-or-laggards-which-public-universities-contribute-most/?elqTrackId=0564b164f3094d5c96bf370c20efd8c2&amp;elq=6d54aa8736bf4227a4a285b6f2603762&amp;elqaid=14694&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqCampaignId=6216\">A report from the Brookings Institution</a> published in July ranks UTA among the nation&#x2019;s top public universities in providing a high-quality college education to students from all income levels.</p>\n<p>Among the nation&#x2019;s 342 selective, four-year public research institutions, Brookings ranked UTA among the top 25 &#x201C;leader&#x201D; universities, which provide high social mobility and produce high levels of impactful research.&#xA0;UTA students from low-income backgrounds are able to move into higher income brackets and advanced careers as a direct result of degrees earned at UTA.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> published a <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/01/low-student-debt.php\">ranking</a> that showed that UTA students graduate with the second-lowest debt in the nation.

It is a division of Macnica Inc., a $3.2 billion global leader in semiconductor distribution and design services.</p>\n<p>Computer vision, or facial recognition, tracks where humans are and how they move. It has many applications, such as unlocking a laptop computer or cell phone, or controlling who can or cannot enter a building. On a larger scale, facial recognition could be used for surveillance of people on terrorist watch lists, but to do so would require scaling up the software to quickly and accurately recognize one or two faces among thousands in an airport or on a city street, and that technology does not yet exist.</p>\n<p>Athitsos, doctoral student Amir Ghaderi and master&#x2019;s student Saif Sayed agreed to work with Macnica because they saw potential to approach their research from a different point of view where research results in a product going to market and not only a paper in an academic journal.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Ten years ago, computer vision wasn&#x2019;t relevant to the economy, but now companies are investing a lot in the technology,&#x201D; Athitsos said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s getting to the point where it&#x2019;s worth asking how or if our work is commercially deployable, and if not, how can we make it so?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Athitsos said working with Macnica has given the team a new point of view.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re doing something useful for them, helping them to transfer technology to the marketplace, and they&#x2019;re helping us to refine our thinking outside of the scope of academia,&#x201D; Athitsos said.</p>\n<p>Ghaderi and Sayed also are benefitting from the collaboration. Sayed is interning at the company and Ghaderi has taken on research for the project at UTA, which will allow him to formulate his own research questions and begin writing papers to add to existing knowledge.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;All of the work that Amir and Saif are doing on this will be highly relevant and make them more marketable as they seek jobs after earning their degrees,&#x201D; Athitsos said.</p>\n<p>This research is just one example of innovative thinking from the Computer Science and Engineering Department in the area of <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a>, one of the themes of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Hong Jiang, Wendell Nedderman Chair and Professor in the department.</p>\n<p>Other examples include Athitsos&#x2019; research that used computer vision to study how a computer can recognize signs in American Sign Language and enable users to search dictionaries of American Sign Language to look up the meaning of an unknown sign, and a current grant by Fillia Makedon, a computer science and engineering professor, who is using computer vision and machine learning to help experts assess learning difficulties in children.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The heart of computer science and engineering is finding ways to use computers more efficiently to improve our interactions with the world around us,&#x201D; Jiang said. &#x201C;This partnership is an example of how knowledge developed in an academic setting can be applied in industry with benefits for all involved.&#x201D;</p>\n<p align=\"right\">--&#xA0; Written by Jeremy Agor</p>\n"

The award is sponsored by the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society. Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I am extremely honored to be recognized with the Marie Sklodowska Curie Award by the IEEE, a very prestigious worldwide professional organization,&#x201D; Nygren said. &#x201C;Madame Curie is a hero in physics and to the world for her pioneering discoveries of radioactive elements and their properties. I am equally humbled to be recognized as contributing a small part to her legacy, in the pursuit of deeply fundamental knowledge.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nygren invented a new particle detection concept, the Time Projection Chamber, in 1974 to enable accurate and complete capture of extremely complex high-energy particles collisions. Such collisions can lead to the production of hundreds or even thousands of new particles. The Time Projection Chamber has been used worldwide for more than four decades in particle detection and discovery, ranging from relativistic heavy ion collisions to the search for Dark Matter and extremely rare nuclear decays.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This award is a wonderful and very well-deserved honor for Dr. Nygren in recognition for his groundbreaking work in particle detection, which has opened the door to discovery in many areas,&#x201D; College of Science Dean Morteza Khaledi said. &#x201C;His distinguished record of achievement is a credit to our college and the University, and his work is a perfect example of the kind of impactful research to which all of us in the College of Science aspire.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nygren received a B.A. in Mathematics-Physics from Whitman College in 1960 and earned his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Washington in 1967. He was a postdoctoral research associate at Nevis Laboratories at Columbia University and became an assistant professor of physics at Columbia in 1969. He moved to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory near Berkeley, Calif., in 1973 as a Division Fellow, then as a Senior Physicist and later as Distinguished Scientist until August 2014, when he joined the UTA Department of Physics.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I know that this is a very great honor and one that is both richly deserved and highly appropriate in light of the importance and lasting impact of Dr. Nygren&#x2019;s contributions to the field,&#x201D; said Alex Weiss, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Physics. &#x201C;I also know that I speak for all of my colleagues in saying how happy we are for David and how proud we are to have him here at UTA and as a member of our department.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The Marie Sklodowska Curie Award is the latest of numerous awards and accolades Nygren has received over the course of his illustrious career. In 2015 he was honored as one of two recipients of the American Physical Society&#x2019;s inaugural Division of Particles and Fields Instrumentation Award for his widespread and lifelong contributions in the field of particle physics. The award specifically recognized Nygren&#x2019;s work which has led to the development by many physicists and engineers of the extremely large volume liquid argon Time Projection Chambers that are now a key element in the global particle physics program. The award will be presented at the 2018 IEEE Nuclear Science and Medical Imaging Symposium in Sydney, Australia in November 2018.</p>\n<p>Among the many other distinguished awards Nygren has received are the Aldo Menzione Prize in 2015, the Berkeley Lab Prize - Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013, the W.K.H. Panofsky Prize in Experimental Particle Physics from the APS in 1998, and the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award from the U.S. Department of Energy in 1985. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2000.</p>\n<p>He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and has served on the executive committee for the APS Division of Particles and Fields, as well as several other distinguished scientific panels and committees.</p>\n<p>Marie Sklodowska Curie was a pioneer in the field of radioactivity, a word that she coined. She and her husband, Pierre Curie, discovered the elements radium and polonium in 1898. She won the Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel in 1903 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911. In 1906 she became the first woman to be named a professor at the University of Paris.</p>\n"

ICT is Information and Communication Technology. Former Odisha Chief Secretary Sahadeva Sahoo co-authored the study.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We discovered that one key was making telemedicine sustainable, from technological and job skills standpoints but especially from a financial standpoint,&#x201D; Mahapatra said. &#x201C;Creating public-private partnerships to establish these telemedicine centers is another key to lasting, thriving telemedicine outposts.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>A telemedicine outlet could cost between $9,000 and $12,000 to start in one of these remote areas, a large amount of money considering the average income level of rural India.</p>\n<p>Mahapatra looked at the strategy and operations of OTTET Telemedicine for his case study. OTTET is a non-profit organization based in the state of Odisha in India. It promotes the use of telemedicine technology to expand the reach of healthcare to rural areas.</p>\n<p>Odisha, one of the 29 states of India, covers about 60,000 square miles with a population of about 42 million. About 83 percent of the population lives in rural areas, according to the 2011 Census of India and Mahapatra&#x2019;s study. The state of healthcare delivery in India is very poor, especially in these remote areas.</p>\n<p>The public health system is run by the state government.</p>\n<p>A major hurdle in successful implementation of ICT-based development projects is lack of local ownership. What Mahapatra discovered was that when funding agencies&#x2019; grants expire, the system suffered or failed and people&#x2019;s healthcare was often sacrificed.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;One key to OTTET&#x2019;s success in implementing telemedicine projects in rural areas is getting someone in the community to invest in a telemedicine project&#x2019;s success,&#x201D; Mahapatra said. &#x201C;OTTET also tackles the lack of technical manpower in rural areas by training unemployed rural youths on telemedicine technology, another factor essential in the project&#x2019;s success.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>What the study calls for is effective public-private partnership.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We discovered that OTTET Telemedicine offers a viable approach to incremental and sustainable implementation of Information and Communications Technology-based development projects as long as there is local ownership and the public-private partnership model at work,&#x201D; Mahapatra said.</p>\n<p>Chandra Subramaniam, interim dean of the UTA College of Business, said Mahapatra&#x2019;s work speaks directly to health and the human condition, one of the pillars of UTA&#x2019;s strategic plan.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The findings of this paper will help create sustainable health delivery models in less developed regions around the world,&#x201D; Subramaniam said. &#x201C;Citation of this study by a major newspaper (the <a href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/aug/13/odisha-model-of-telemedicine-improves-healthcare-1642566.html\">New Indian Express</a>) in India brings positive publicity to UTA and helps extend its influence around the world.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mahapatra started at UTA in 1998. His research interests include ICT for global development, healthcare information systems, data warehousing, data quality, agile software development and IT project management.</p>\n<p>His research publications have appeared in various journals including&#xA0;<i>MIS Quarterly</i>,&#xA0;<i>Decision Support Systems</i>,&#xA0;<i>Information &amp; Management</i> and&#xA0;<i>Communications of the ACM</i>.&#xA0; He is a recipient of the&#xA0;<i>Distinguished Research Publication Award</i>&#xA0;and the&#xA0;<i>Distinguished Professional Publication Award</i>&#xA0;from the College of Business.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

This section of the mantle was pushed upwards to the top of the mountains as a result of the Indian Plate pushing north into Asia, displacing the ancient Tethys ocean floor and underlying mantle to create the Himalayan Mountain Belt around 55 million years ago.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is important as it means that we can analyze the nature of the mantle under the earth&#x2019;s crust, at depths where drilling cannot reach,&#x201D; Basu explained. &#x201C;One key initial discovery was finding microdiamonds whose host rocks originated in the mantle transition zone, at depths between 410 and 660 kilometers below the earth&#x2019;s surface.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Neo Tethyan spreading center\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/fig-3.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Figure showing the earth&apos;s mantle</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>By studying the host rocks and associated minerals, the scientists had a unique opportunity to probe the nature of the deep mantle. They found primary hydrocarbon and hydrogen fluid inclusions along with microdiamonds by using Laser Ramon Spectroscopic study. The discovery also showed that the environment in the deep mantle transition zone depths where the diamond is formed is devoid of oxygen.</p>\n<p>The researchers suggest that during the advective transport or mantle up-welling into shallower mantle zones, the hydrocarbon fluids become oxidized and precipitate diamond, a mechanism that may also be responsible for forming larger diamonds like the world&#x2019;s most valuable, Koh-i-Noor or Mountain of Light diamond, now in the Queen of England&#x2019;s crown.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We also found that the deep mantle upwelling can oxidize oxygen-impoverished fluids to produce water and carbon dioxide that are well-known to produce deep mantle melting,&#x201D; said Souvik Das, UTA post-doctoral research scholar.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This means that many of the key compounds affecting evolution like carbon dioxide and water are generated within the mantle,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>The paper was published as &#x201C;<a href=\"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/geology/article/45/8/755/207630/in-situ-peridotitic-diamond-in-indus-ophiolite\">In situ peridotitic diamond in Indus ophiolite sourced from hydrocarbon fluids in the mantle transition zone</a>,&#x201D; in The Geological Society of America&#x2019;s Geology journal August 2017 edition as a cover article. &#xA0;B.

Its primary role is to carry instructions from DNA.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28756022/?i=2&amp;from=brotto\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> published in the journal Gene this month, Marco Brotto, a professor of nursing at the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, and Subhrangsu Mandal, an associate professor of chemistry, write that hypoxia helps aid the growth of cancer cells in people with the HOTAIR gene. The paper was co-written with three graduate students from UTA&#x2019;s Department of Chemistry: Arunoday Bhan, Paromita Deb and Nadine Shihabeddin; and Khairul Ansari, a former UTA adjunct faculty in that department. Brotto and Mandal were the paper&#x2019;s senior authors.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Noncoding RNAs are a newly discovered class of molecules that are emerging as a master regulator or facilitator of cancer.&#xA0; In this study, the authors show a connection between Hypoxia and HOTAIR.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This could have very important implications,&#x201D; said Brotto, the George W. and Hazel M. Jay professor at UTA&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation. &#x201C;We know that with aging, humans have higher probability of cancer, but with aging, humans also have more Hypoxia, because of reduced respiratory capacity.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Hypoxia is a condition in which a person experiences low oxygen. Among other things, oxygen provides nutrition to brain cells, muscle cells, cardiac cells and burns fat. Conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, pollution, environment causes, climate change and aging are among the biggest causes of Hypoxia, said Brotto.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption250\"><img alt=\"Dr. Subhrangsu Mandal\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/subhra-mandal.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Dr. Subhrangsu Mandal</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;Hypoxia is a critical driver of tumor growth,&#x201D; said Mandal, adding that the study offers an opportunity for novel drug treatments of cancer.</p>\n<p>Brotto and Mandal have been studying Hypoxia and HOTAIR respectively for more than a decade. Together, they worked on this study for more than two years by performing systematic experiments on different cells in their labs.</p>\n<p>Brotto said this study offers hope for the development of a drug to inhibit the development of cancer by targeting HOTAIR.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In the meantime, we all can do things to stave off hypoxia, such as regular exercise, nutrition and improving our climate conditions,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>Anne Bavier, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation, said this study is a boon for the college, the university and the fight against cancer. Advancing health and the human condition is one of one the four pillars of UTA&#x2019;s strategic plan.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;For more than a century, scientists have been taking a sledgehammer at this formidable malady,&#x201D; said Bavier. &#x201C;Yes, we still have a long way to go but we have also come a long way. This most recent work by Brotto, Mandal and their fellow researchers strikes another important blow against this disease.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Brotto said this study is a good example of why science funding is so important in health care research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This discovery was only possible because of continued substantial grant funding,&#x201D; Brotto said. &#x201C;Otherwise this devastating diseases, which we are very close to finding cures for, we&#x2019;ll never find them and that would be a shame.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Brotto and Mandal plan to submit a joint grant proposal to the National Institutes of Health later as part of their efforts to further their study of HOTAIR.</p>\n"

Photo courtesy Austin ISD.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Bordeaux&#x2019;s journey included a stop at The University of Texas at Arlington, where she earned her bachelor&#x2019;s degree and learned from professors she describes as some of the most influential people in her life.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve asked people who went to other universities about their relationships with their professors and it&#x2019;s not the same. To this day, I can lean on any one of mine and they&#x2019;ll help. They continue to be mentors. I can&#x2019;t say enough about UTA. It remains my home away from home,&#x201D; Bordeaux said.</p>\n<p>She fell in love with UTA even before she became a student, having frequently visited her mother, Lisa, who began working at UTA in 1997 and is currently a Team Lead in the Office of Student Accounts&#x2019; Customer Service Communications Center.</p>\n<p>School wasn&#x2019;t always a source of fond memories for Bordeaux. Her high school years were particularly rough. She dropped out during her junior year and moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film. She gained priceless experience in the film industry for several years, but she struggled to pay bills.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I started filming multiple shows and projects with the Debbie Allen Dance Academy and I was so moved watching Debbie lean on her industry experience as she taught her students how to dance and how to succeed in that industry,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Watching her inspired me to find ways to pass my love of film to young people, and help them find ways to gain industry experience.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>She left L.A., moved home to North Texas and enrolled at UTA to study film and photography. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from UTA&#x2019;s College of Liberal Arts in 2012, obtained an alternative certification to teach and entered the classroom in the Austin Independent School District in 2013. Today, she is a media arts teacher at Lanier Early College High School and making a clear difference in her students&#x2019; lives.</p>\n<p>Bordeaux recently was named the 2018 Texas Secondary Teacher of the Year, and chosen as the state finalist for the Texas Teacher of the Year. She is now eligible for the National Teacher of the Year Award.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;People ask me what makes me different and I don&#x2019;t really know. I want to give my students the best experience possible. I customize my teaching to each individual student because it helps them understand themselves, which helps them find their own voice,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p>She credits her UTA professors with influencing her teaching style.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Kenda was so honest with her critiques. Her honesty led me to discover my artistic voice,&#x201D; Bordeaux said of UTA Professor of Photography Kenda North. &#x201C;She allowed me to do a hybrid study of film and photography, and that inspired me to spend time with my individual students and customize their experiences. I cannot say enough about the entire Art and Art History Department at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>North remembers Bordeaux as a gifted and generous student.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Tara&#x2019;s ideas and work were always unique and maintained intelligence and humor,&#x201D; North said. &#x201C;I am not surprised that she has excelled as a teacher and I am very proud she found a career path that brings her and her students great rewards.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Bordeaux is not the first Maverick graduate to receive this prestigious honor. Shanna Peeples, the 2015 Texas Teacher of the Year who went on to be named National Teacher of the Year, earned her Master of Education degree from UTA. The Texas PTA Elementary Teacher of the Year for 2015 was Austin Aeschbacher. He received the honor while he was pursuing his master&#x2019;s in education at UTA. Sarah Carter, who earned a Master of Education in Curriculum and Instruction from UTA, was a finalist for Oklahoma&#x2019;s 2017 Teacher of the Year award.</p>\n"

Their computations revealed that an additional Earth-like planet with a dynamically stable configuration may be residing at a distance ranging from 0.25 to 2.0 astronomical unit (AU) from the star.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;According to our calculations, this hypothetical alien world would probably have a mass between 1 to 15 Earth&apos;s masses,&#x201D; said the lead author Suman Satyal, UTA physics researcher, lecturer and laboratory supervisor. The paper is co-authored by John Griffith, UTA undergraduate student and long-time UTA physics professor Zdzislaw Musielak.</p>\n<p>The astrophysicists published their findings this week as <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa80e2\">&#x201C;Dynamics of a probable Earth-Like Planet in the GJ 832 System&#x201D;</a> in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/ss-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Lead author Dr. Suman Satyal, UTA physics researcher, lecturer and laboratory supervisor</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>UTA Physics Chair Alexander Weiss congratulated the researchers on their work, which underscores the University&#x2019;s commitment to data-driven discovery within its <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/index.php\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is an important breakthrough demonstrating the possible existence of a potential new planet orbiting a star close to our own,&#x201D; Weiss said. &#x201C;The fact that Dr. Satyal was able to demonstrate that the planet could maintain a stable orbit in the habitable zone of a red dwarf for more than 1 billion years is extremely impressive and demonstrates the world class capabilities of our department&#x2019;s astrophysics group.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Gliese 832 is a red dwarf and has just under half the <a href=\"http://phys.org/tags/mass/\">mass</a> and radius of our sun. The star is orbited by a giant Jupiter-like exoplanet designated Gliese 832b and by a super-Earth planet Gliese 832c. The gas giant with 0.64 Jupiter masses is orbiting the star at a distance of 3.53 AU, while the other planet is potentially a rocky world, around five times more massive than the Earth, residing very close its host star&#x2014;about 0.16 AU.</p>\n<p>For this research, the team analyzed the simulated data with an injected Earth-mass planet on this nearby planetary system hoping to find a stable orbital configuration for the planet that may be located in a vast space between the two known <a href=\"http://phys.org/tags/planets/\">planets</a>.</p>\n<p>Gliese 832b and Gliese 832c were discovered by the <a href=\"http://phys.org/tags/radial+velocity+technique/\">radial velocity technique</a>, which detects variations in the velocity of the central star, due to the changing direction of the gravitational pull from an unseen exoplanet as it orbits the star. By regularly looking at the spectrum of a star &#x2013; and so, measuring its velocity &#x2013; one can see if it moves periodically due to the influence of a companion.</p>\n<p>&quot;We also used the integrated data from the time evolution of orbital parameters to generate the synthetic radial velocity curves of the known and the Earth-like planets in the system,&#x201D; said Satyal, who earned his Ph.D. in Astrophysics from UTA in 2014. &quot;We obtained several radial velocity curves for varying masses and distances indicating a possible new middle planet,&quot; the astrophysicist noted.</p>\n<p>For instance, if the new planet is located around 1 AU from the star, it has an upper mass limit of 10 Earth masses and a generated radial velocity signal of 1.4 meters per second. A planet with about the mass of the Earth at the same location would have radial velocity signal of only 0.14 m/s, thus much smaller and hard to detect with the current technology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The existence of this possible planet is supported by long-term orbital stability of the system, orbital dynamics and the synthetic radial velocity signal analysis&#x201D;, Satyal said. &#x201C;At the same time, a significantly large number of radial velocity observations, transit method studies, as well as direct imaging are still needed to confirm the presence of possible new planets in the Gliese 832 system.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In 2014, Noyola, Satyal and Musielak published findings related to radio emissions indicating that an exomoon could be orbiting an exoplanet in <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/791/1/25/meta;jsessionid=B7BEDFD54EF9C47ACF16EA618713C59E.ip-10-40-2-73\">The Astrophysical Journal</a>, where they suggested that interactions between Jupiter&#x2019;s magnetic field and its moon Io may be used to detect exomoons at distant exoplanetary systems.</p>\n<p>Zdzislaw Musielak joined the UTA physics faculty in 1998 following his doctoral program at the University of Gdansk in Poland and appointments at the University of Heidelberg in Germany; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and the University of Alabama in Huntsville.<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"></span></p>\n<p>Suman Satyal is a research assistant, laboratory supervisor and physics lecturer at UTA and his research area includes the detection of exoplanets and exomoons, and orbital stability analysis of Exoplanets in single and binary star systems.

UTA is making distinct progress toward this goal through innovative campus growth plans, student life initiatives, community partnerships and new academic course offerings.</p>\n<p><b>Smart growth</b></p>\n<p>UTA is currently building a $46.5 million residence and student life facility and a $125 million <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/seir/\">Science and Engineering Innovation and Research Building</a> using sustainable materials, practices and designs such as high energy efficient heating and cooling systems and water conservation methods.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/water-conservation1.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>The Green at College Park acts as an ecological water detention system and large-scale rain garden.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>College Park Center, which opened in 2012, is a $78 million LEED Gold certified special events center with an adjacent green space. The Green at College Park received one of the first three certifications issues worldwide by the Sustainable Sites Initiative and acts as an ecological water detention system and large-scale rain garden. The entire College Park District is rated as LEED silver.</p>\n<p>The Engineering Research Building is a 234,000-square-foot LEED Gold certified structure that includes a 28,000-gallon capacity rainwater collection system; 28 percent of the building materials used during construction were manufactured from recycled materials.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s Park North and Park Central parking garages feature 1,638 photovaltaic panels to capture solar energy.</p>\n<p>Smart growth also means great care is taken when old campus structures are demolished. Recyclable materials are removed from demolition debris in order to divert construction waste from landfills.</p>\n<p><b>Student involvement</b></p>\n<p>UTA launched a <a href=\"../08/bike-share.php\">bike-sharing program</a> in September and a car-sharing program in 2015.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Student organizations such as Mavs Go Green encourage environmentally friendly decisions among students and raise awareness about sustainability. Mavs Go Green members help increase recycling at Arlington&#x2019;s AT&amp;T Stadium by volunteering during large events to divert waste into recycling bins. The organization also won UTA&#x2019;s Outstanding Contribution to the Greater Community Award. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Other student organizations encourage recycling in residence halls and responsible food consumption in the University&#x2019;s dining facilities. A composting program recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency turns more than 32 tons of food and yard waste into mulch and soil for campus use on an annual basis.</p>\n<p>UTA encourages students, faculty and staff to be mindful of printing practices. Catalogs, class schedules and many information packets are online only.</p>\n<p><b>Community partnerships&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p>UTA was the first educational entity to partner with Air North Texas, a regional clean air public awareness campaign. The University also partnered with City of Arlington on a carbon footprint analysis that helped the city reduce energy consumption by 25 percent. A community garden on one-half of an acre of UTA property serves as a site for the community to learn about sustainable choices. During 2015, UTA donated 900 pounds of food grown at the garden to Mission Arlington, a local shelter and outreach center.</p>\n<p><b>Academic programs</b></p>\n<p>UTA offers more than 60 courses within 16 academic departments which include sustainability as part of their curriculum, ensuring UTA&#x2019;s graduates are skilled in sustainable practices and ready to lead communities across the world as they face difficult challenges related to growth, waste, and resource management. The College of Engineering offers a minor in sustainable engineering while the College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs offers a minor in environmental and sustainability studies.</p>\n<p>Through a partnership with the Danish Institute for Study Abroad, UTA students are eligible for an intensive study abroad experiential learning opportunity focused on sustainability efforts in Denmark and other European countries. Students can also participate in paid sustainability-related internships with UTA&#x2019;s collaborative community partners.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s Solid Waste Institute for Sustainability is educating and training solid waste management personnel from developed and developing countries across the world new techniques in landfill operation, recycling and waste management.</p>\n"

H. Hereford University Center.</p>\n<p>Of the&#xA0;244&#xA0;new Terry Foundation scholarship awardees this year,&#xA0;15&#xA0;are entering UTA. In addition, of the 120 new Transfer Terry Scholarship awardees this year, 12 are entering UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is a growing urban research university with highly ranked programs in many disciplines,&#x201D; said Yvonne Moody, president of the Terry Foundation. &#x201C;We are excited about partnering with such a widely respected institution and believe that UTA provides an excellent environment to foster the growth of Terry Scholars as individuals and as leaders during their time on campus and beyond.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>William Gunn, director of programs at UTA&#x2019;s University College, said that considering the University&#x2019;s focus on dedicated student support, joining the Terry program was a foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p>The Terry Foundation was established by Houston philanthropists Howard and Nancy Terry, and it is the largest private source of scholarships in Texas.</p>\n<p>For Traditional Terry Scholars at UTA, the cost of a four-year undergraduate degree, including housing, books and supplies, and cost of living, will roughly total $98,800. The Terry Scholars won&#x2019;t have to worry about a single cent. Another area of financial support comes in a stipend for study-abroad expenses.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This scholarship opens opportunities for students who wouldn&#x2019;t be able to afford or even pursue their dreams of going to college,&#x201D; Gunn said. &#x201C;These students receive great opportunities for success that extend well beyond walking across the stage. Terry Scholars network and through that networking create even additional professional opportunities that spread past the classroom and that first job.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The 2017-18 traditional scholarship recipients, their hometowns and intended majors are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hana Ali, Arlington, biochemistry,</li>\n<li>Destiny Burnett, Keller, anthropology,</li>\n<li>Jacqueline Garcia-Torres, McKinney, business,</li>\n<li>Samuel Greiwe, Pearland, aerospace engineering,</li>\n<li>Carter Harris, Bells, aerospace engineering,</li>\n<li>Rhys Jensen, Pampa, biomedical engineering,</li>\n<li>Joseph Johnson, Lakeside, mechanical engineering,</li>\n<li>Alexia Koltes, McKinney, architecture,</li>\n<li>Heather Lake, Tomball, biochemistry,</li>\n<li>Dustin Le, Cedar Hill, computer science and engineering,</li>\n<li>Paola Puentes, Irving, anthropology,</li>\n<li>Isaac Ramadan, Arlington, accounting,</li>\n<li>Juanita Segoviano, Duncanville, nursing,</li>\n<li>Leah Volkman, El Paso, nursing,</li>\n<li>Alexavia Wright, Marlin, nursing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The 2017-18 transfer scholarship recipients, their hometowns and intended majors are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adriana Amaya, Dallas, political science,</li>\n<li>Mariah Bradshaw, Denton, social work,</li>\n<li>Paul Djangang, Irving, math &#x2013; Uteach,</li>\n<li>Precious Dunamis, Arlington, business,</li>\n<li>Shawn Hurrigan, Arlington, nursing,</li>\n<li>Calvin Johnson, Fort Worth, English,</li>\n<li>Rebeca Lallave, Euless, Spanish,</li>\n<li>Kanyon Loyd, Fort Worth, computer science and engineering,</li>\n<li>Miguel Mendoza, Dallas, computer science and engineering,</li>\n<li>Nathalie Mora, Grand Prairie, English,</li>\n<li>Judith Rascon, Red Oak, nursing,</li>\n<li>Layne Stanush, Midlothian, chemistry.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The new Terry Scholars were selected at statewide interviews held earlier this year. In addition to completing an application, each student writes an essay detailing his or her academic and personal journey to date, and submits transcripts from high school or all post-secondary institutions. Following the conclusion of each cycle of interviews, the Foundation sends offer letters to selected nominees, and status letters to candidates who will not receive a scholarship offer.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My first year as a Terry Scholar has been terrific. Everyone here at UTA is great and wants to help you succeed,&#x201D; said Bailey Jones, an English major, and member of the 2016 Terry class. &#x201C;That caring attitude has helped with my success here at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Members of UTA&apos;s inaugural class of Terry Foundation Scholars participated in a volleyball match at Southfork Ranch. The spring 2017 picnic for UTA scholars was hosted by the Terry Foundation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Part of the success of the Terrys is that they share the same residence hall, which encourages group bonding through monthly events,&#x201D; Gunn said. &#x201C;That bonding helps inside and outside the classroom. It shows in the grades the Terrys achieve and the confidence they exude when you meet them.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Visit www.uta.edu/terryscholars or email&#xA0;<a href=\"mailto:terryscholars@uta.edu\">terryscholars@uta.edu</a> for more information about how to apply for the Terry Foundation Scholar Program at UTA.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Don Kennard, D-Fort Worth, in 1967 during the 60<sup>th</sup> Legislative Session. It directed the UT System Board of Regents to establish and maintain the Institute for Urban Studies in the Fort Worth-Dallas metropolitan area.</p>\n<p>Charged with addressing Texas&#x2019; growing urban challenges, the Institute had immediate tasks to address. By 1965, more than 75 percent of Texas&#x2019; population lived in cities &#x2013; primarily Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio &#x2013; compared with only 45 percent in 1940.</p>\n<p>Soon after the Institute&#x2019;s creation, a master&#x2019;s program, three faculty and 15 students started studying urban issues and public affairs. SUPA became a reality in 1990 and evolved into a highly ranked school with seven degree programs and close to 1,000 students.</p>\n<p>In 2015, UTA&#x2019;s School of Urban and Public Affairs merged with the School of Architecture to become a new collaborative &#x2013; the College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs or CAPPA.</p>\n<p>To honor the rich histories of those two schools, CAPPA will host the &#x201C;SOA + SUPA 50th Anniversaries Exhibit&#x201D; through Oct. 6 in the Max W. Sullivan Gallery located in the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/maps/?building=ARCH\">CAPPA building</a>, 601 W. Nedderman Drive.</p>\n<p>A &#x201C;Welcome Back&#x201D; celebration for CAPPA students will be held 5 to 7 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 6, in the Richard B. Myrick Courtyard adjacent to the CAPPA building.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption666\"><img alt=\"School of Urban and Public Affairs timeline\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/50th-anniversary-supa-timeline.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>School of Urban and Public Affairs timeline</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>An invitation-only celebration will be held from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Friday, Sept. 8, for alumni, donors, faculty and staff in the CAPPA Building.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our emphasis has not changed from the beginning,&#x201D; said Enid Arvidson, associate professor of planning and public affairs and chair of the SUPA 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Committee. &#x201C;We need to continue to fuel a future generation of planners, policy makers and administrators that are equipped to meet the growing challenges of urban settings.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Even though, the North Texas population was only about 2 million in 1967, the complexity and nature of urban issues required an interdisciplinary approach. Latest estimates peg today&#x2019;s North Texas population at more than 7.1 million.</p>\n<p>The Institute of Urban Studies hired three inaugural faculty members &#x2013; sociologist Paul Geisel, economist James Cornehls and political scientist Delbert Taebel &#x2013; to develop the initial Master&#x2019;s of Urban Affairs program, which began with a student body of less than 30.</p>\n<p>The School of Architecture&#x2019;s roots date back to 1948 when a two-year technical program was started in the Department of Engineering by architect Professor George Shupee, who taught Architectural Studies.</p>\n<p>Professors Lee Wright, Dan Spears and Richard B. Ferrier started the initiative to expand the two-year technical drafting program into a four-year undergraduate&#xA0;and two-year graduate program with&#xA0;degree options in architecture, interior design, building systems, landscape architecture, urban design, city and regional planning, and environmental studies.</p>\n<p>A new Department of Architecture was established in the College of Liberal Arts in 1970. By 1974, after significant expansion, the department became the School of Architecture and Environmental Design.</p>\n<p>The establishment of the Department of Architecture, created the fourth School of Architecture in Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Architecture has been a staple in the UTA community for decades,&#x201D; said Steve Quevedo, associate professor of architecture and chair of the SOA 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary Committee. &#x201C;We take a look at our history, which is important to do, but we keep our eyes focused on the future and where new demands in the profession take us.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The rich histories and significant contributions of the SOA and SUPA to education, design, planning, research and service &#x2013; and the uncovering of some surprising historical overlaps and encounters &#x2013; will be remembered, retold and recorded with an eye to the present and future.</p>\n<p>Two historical booklets have been produced to document the histories of the schools, which now make up CAPPA. Oral interviews also were conducted with SOA and SUPA pioneers and faculty members.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>CAPPA Interim Dean Ron Elsenbaumer said much has changed since 1967 when UTA enrollment was about 11,500 and faculty numbered less than 500. Today, enrollment has eclipsed 58,000 students and faculty members is about 1,700. Texas&#x2019; population is now more than 27 million, which continues to present planning challenges that the Institute and CAPPA address.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The Institute, the School of Architecture and the School of Urban and Public Affairs have touched so many lives in North Texas and the world,&#x201D; Elsenbaumer said. &#x201C;From architecture to planning to transportation to public policy to landscape architecture to interior design and a host of other topics, these two schools have contributed greatly to the urban landscape. Now, with all of these programs under one roof, CAPPA continues to be the agenda setter and leader in these areas.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Elsenbaumer said the Texas Legislature also deserves thanks for seeing the need in 1967 to create the Institute.</p>\n<p>UTA could not have had a better ally in Kennard, either. The Fort Worth lawmaker was a constant friend to higher education. In his Austin American-Statesman obituary, Barnes said that during the 1950s and &apos;60s there was no better friend to public and higher education than Kennard, who once filibustered for 29 hours and 22 minutes to pass a bill making UTA a four-year institution.</p>\n"

For a long time, wireless technology companies have been using coherent communications links, where the information is encoded in both amplitude or strength of the signal and phase or time alignment of the signals at radio frequencies. Recently, the coherent communications at much higher optical frequencies are beginning to be adopted for use by the fiber communications industry as well.</p>\n<p>The new equipment will enable UTA researchers to perform high-speed coherent communications and signal processing experiments with both optical and electronic signals, even under conditions where the received signal&#x2019;s phase is scrambled by environmental perturbations such as temperature fluctuations or acoustic vibrations of a fiber-optic cable buried next to a busy road.</p>\n<p>This technology has three parts: the ability to generate arbitrary electronic waveforms at very high speeds, the ability to transfer these signals to multiple optical carrier frequencies and the ability to coherently detect and digitize such high-speed signals. The third part will be implemented using a real-time oscilloscope with bandwidth exceeding 65 GHz, and the phases of the detected signals can be subsequently unscrambled by signal-processing algorithms.</p>\n<p>The new equipment will lead to higher complexity of data that can be transmitted, as well as new capabilities for non-classical communications that have not been explored yet. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This equipment will allow us to bridge the gap between classical communications and quantum communications and significantly increase data capacity,&#x201D; Vasilyev said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We also hope to expand the types of projects that are of interest to local industry. There are several companies in the DFW Metroplex that want to work with us, but don&#x2019;t have the equipment. With this addition, we can be a one-stop shop for the local communications industry.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Jonathan Bredow, chair of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/ee\">Electrical Engineering Department</a>, says that Vasilyev&#x2019;s grant will elevate the department&#x2019;s status and open new avenues for collaboration with local industry, underscoring the University&#x2019;s emphasis on <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a> contained within the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/index.php\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Vasilyev has long been working at the leading edge of optics technology, and this equipment will allow him to expand his research beyond its current limits,&#x201D; Bredow said. &#x201C;We look forward to becoming the &#x2018;go-to&#x2019; institution in the region for industry&#x2019;s high-speed data-processing needs.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Vasilyev joined UTA in 2003 after spending several years in optical telecom industry. He was promoted to professor in 2013 and is a Fellow of The Optical Society. His research focuses on nonlinear and quantum optics, optical communication systems and devices, and nanophotonics. He has earned more than $3.4 million in grants in his career and holds 10 U.S. patents.</p>\n<p>Several other UTA electrical engineers are conducting research in optics, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Robert Magnusson (electrical engineering) is a charter Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors and a Life Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He leads UT Arlington&#x2019;s Nanophotonics Device Group, which pursues theoretical and experimental research in periodic nanostructures, nanolithography, nanophotonics, nanoelectronics, nanoplasmonics, and optical bio- and chemical sensors. Magnusson holds 30 issued and pending patents and has garnered more than $10 million in research funding and endowments for UTA since becoming the Texas Instruments Distinguished University Chair in Nanoelectronics in 2008.</li>\n<li>Weidong Zhou (electrical engineering) is a Fellow of the International Society for Optical Engineering and holds three issued patents. His work is related to optical technology and putting lasers on silicon chips, and he has been the primary investigator on research grants totaling nearly $6 million since joining UTA in 2004.</li>\n<li>Alice Sun (electrical engineering) earned an NSF CAREER award in 2016 and has been the primary investigator on research grants totaling more than $900,000 since beginning her career at the UT Arlington in 2013.

Karbhari and Acosta were honored for their collaborative work in meeting the need for educating highly skilled leaders in construction through the development of new programs and partnerships.</p>\n<p>UTA recently established a <a href=\"../02/construction-management-degree.php\">bachelor&#x2019;s degree in construction management</a>, adding to its portfolio of degrees aimed at highly sought-after professionals in the field of construction. The University already offers specialized degrees in architectural engineering at the baccalaureate level and construction engineering at the master&#x2019;s level.</p>\n<p>The only degree of its kind in North Texas, the B.S. in construction management meets the region&#x2019;s growing demand for professionals skilled not only in building, but also in managing the scope, budget and schedule for construction projects while consistently meeting quality, safety and environmental demands.</p>\n<p>RHCA&#x2019;s Vanguard Award recognizes individuals or entities who are leaders in improving the construction industry. It is presented once every five years. Previous recipients are Home Depot and DFW International Airport.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Collaboration and partnerships between academia and industry are critical to the future, both to ensure that we develop a highly skilled workforce at the cutting edge of technology and professional practice, and as a means of catalyzing&#xA0;and enhancing economic development,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;UTA, through its tremendous faculty and staff, is focused on leading in educating not just the workforce of tomorrow but also providing the intellectual leadership for the future. I&apos;m extremely grateful to Arcilia Acosta for her support and guidance both as a leading construction professional as a THECB member, and for lending her expertise in her field to enabling this successful outcome.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The bachelor&#x2019;s in construction management degree was launched at UTA in the spring of 2017 and features innovative curriculum and instruction practices. The degree and curriculum were developed by UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/ce/\">Department of Civil Engineering</a>, led by its chair Professor Ali Abolmaali in consultation with Acosta and leaders of the construction sector in Dallas-Fort Worth.</p>\n<p>As sole owner and CEO of CARCON Industries and Construction and CEO of STL Engineers, Acosta provided UTA invaluable insight in designing a degree that will produce the graduates that the state and especially North Texas need. Demand for construction managers in Texas is expected to increase by more than 25 percent by 2022, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a tremendous example of UTA listening to industry and workforce needs and responding with a new and very useful degree program,&#x201D; said Acosta, who was appointed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott in 2016 to the board of the premier organization that coordinates the state&#x2019;s public higher education systems and has a substantial impact on education policy. &#x201C;I am honored to be recognized with President Karbhari for the development of a degree that will undoubtedly fill labor demands and contribute positively to the local, state and national economies. This is a true example of Governor Abbott&#x2019;s 60x30TX goal: By 2030, at least 60 percent of Texans ages 24-34 will have a certificate or degree.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Establishing a construction management degree is one of several key initiatives of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020 <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a> which is developed around the focus of enabling a sustainable megacity by harnessing the considerable talent and expertise of the University&#x2019;s faculty, staff and students in addressing issues pertinent to the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan area as it grows to megacity status and thereby enhancing the quality of life and economic development of the region.</p>\n<p>Karbhari and Acosta received the Vanguard Award during RHCA&apos;s 11<sup>th</sup> Annual Awards Luncheon on Oct. 19 in Fort Worth.</p>\n"

        "body": "\n<p>Efficient communication between neurons in the brain is the key to achieving cognitive function.</p>\n<p>A University of Texas at Arlington researcher is working to determine how mechanical forces such as blasts or repeated blows to the head could damage neurons and lead to neurological disorders.</p>\n<p>Ashfaq Adnan, an associate professor in UTA&#x2019;s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, recently was awarded a three-year, $613,079 grant from the Office of Naval Research to show the potential link between blast-like trauma and neurological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Ashfaq Adnan\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/ashfaq-adnan-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Ashfaq Adnan, a UTA associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, was awarded an Office of Naval Research grant to show the potential link between blast-like trauma and neurological disorders.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>This trauma could be caused by an explosion, such as an improvised explosive device in a war zone, but could also be a result of repeated blows to the head suffered by boxers and football players.</p>\n<p>When the head is impacted by blast-like mechanical force, the resulting pressure waves are transmitted to the interior of the brain, which is built with more than 100 billion neuron cells and related structures. The movement of ions across neural membranes creates electrical activity, which, in turn, enables the ions to move in and out of the cell. This movement alters the charge balance across the membrane that allows the axon to generate action potential and neurotransmission, which help neurons communicate with other neurons.</p>\n<p>Action potential occurs when a neuron sends information down an axon, away from the cell body.</p>\n<p>However, if the neuron has suffered electrochemical, structural or physiological damage, action potential and neurotransmission may not take place and the neuron&#x2019;s ability to communicate may be disrupted. This could lead to a delayed or abnormal neurological response, such as those experienced by people with PTSD, Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and CTE.</p>\n<p>Adnan and his team will create a computational model using tools developed in his previous research in the field, then apply it to a full-blown, atomic-scale model to study how electrochemical changes affect the neurons&#x2019; processes.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It all boils down to how neurons function in the brain. Any disruption in neuronal communication means that something is not going right,&#x201D; Adnan said. &#x201C;In technical terms, we&#x2019;re trying to develop a model that can trace action potential inside neuron for different neuron configurations. It will be like developing a tool that can image the brain&#x2019;s version of an electrocardiogram, or EKG. The way EKG reveals the condition of someone&#x2019;s heart, we wish to develop a tool that will be able to reveal, through computer simulation, the condition of brain&#x2019;s neuron.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Peter Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering, said Adnan is advancing knowledge in the way physicians understand and diagnose neurological disorders. The work is representative of UTA&#x2019;s increasing research expertise focused on advancing <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a> under the University&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This grant will allow Dr. Adnan to build upon his findings and potentially discover a groundbreaking link between brain trauma and neurological disorders. With that knowledge physicians and scientists could make great strides in treating neurological disorders that impact so many of our combat veterans and others,&#x201D; Crouch said.</p>\n<p>One postdoctoral associate and three doctoral students will work on this research area. Adnan is thankful for MAE&#x2019;s and COE&#x2019;s support of the project.</p>\n<p>Adnan has been involved in more than $2 million in research support since he joined UTA in 2010 following post-doctoral work at Northwestern University. He earned his doctoral degree in aerospace engineering from Purdue University.</p>\n<p>In collaboration with U.S. Naval Research Lab scientists, Adnan has recently published an article in <i><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742706117307146\">Acta Biomaterialia</a></i> that reveals dynamic cavitation mechanisms in soft gelatins. Since soft materials like gels have comparable properties of brain tissues, from a medical standpoint, understanding dynamic cavitation within soft materials is a stepping stone for understanding cavitation damage in brains.</p>\n<p>Last summer, Adnan published research findings in Nature&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05790-3\"><i>Scientific Reports</i></a> revealing that battlefield blasts may cause cavitation in the brain&#x2019;s perineuronal nets, which, in turn, may collapse and cause neuronal damage. Cavitation is the development of bubbles, much like those that develop around a ship&#x2019;s spinning propellers</p>\n<p>In 2016, Adnan won a three-year, $255,126 grant through the ONR&#x2019;s Warfighter Performance Department to develop a computer model for understanding the role of blast-induced cavitation in neuron damage. In 2015, he won a highly competitive $130,000 Early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research, or EAGER, award from the National Science Foundation to advance his work to modify molecular structures and blend ceramics to create new material that would be less brittle but retain the strength of the original ceramic.</p>\n<p>Adnan also has received summer faculty fellowships with the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the Office of Naval Research.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\n"

This study, which was funded with a $20,000 seed grant from UTA&#x2019;s Interdisciplinary Research Program, found that after three weeks of interactions, there was a significant drop in depression and increase in human-robot social engagement among those older adults.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are now looking to make the experience more immersive so that the robot and the adults play out an entire scene of Shakespeare together, such as the Romeo and Juliet balcony scene,&#x201D; Greer said. &#x201C;We hypothesize that the more immersive the theatre intervention, the deeper and more positive the responses in older adults will be in regards to depression and social engagement.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The new lab will feature two robots from SoftBank Robotics, NAO&#xAE; and Pepper&#xAE;. Pepper is a 4-foot-tall humanoid robot with large, expressive eyes and lifelike gestures that can connect with people on an emotional level. NAO is a smaller humanoid robot, designed to be an interactive companion.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/students-interacting-robot.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Students interacting with&#xA0;NAO&#xAE;</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;We want to look at what it means to have a robot in the room, and plan to use theatre methodology to make that experience as engaging as possible,&#x201D; Greer added. &#x201C;Both robots are also actively used in the curriculum of the course I teach, &#x2018;Robots, Digital Humanities and Theatre&#x2019; every semester, which involves hands-on student/robot interactions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The lab is designed with home spaces for older adults featuring mid-century furniture as well as a more modern play space for projects using children or younger adults.</p>\n<p>In a related project, Fields is using $10,000 she received as a UTA Presidential Fellow to study whether theatre interventions with robots can also have positive effects on older adults with dementia or cognitive decline who live in assisted living facilities.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our hope is that these different studies could show that our Shakespeare robot intervention can have a general positive therapeutic effect on older adults, and provide new tools for those working with them to reduce depression and increase engagement,&#x201D; Fields said.</p>\n<p>UTA researchers have also been subcontracted by Georgia Tech to carry out research on how to create a collaborative relationship between an older adult parental caregiver, a care receipient with a developmental disability, and a socially assistive robot in order to develop engaging interaction that will allow caretakers to take some respite. UTA&#x2019;s sub award is $108,000 and will be led on the UTA site by Xu, who specializes in aging.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We all know that burnout among caregivers is a huge issue, especially for older adult caregivers who care for a loved one with a developmental disability,&#x201D; Xu said. &#x201C;If we can create an atmosphere of trust with the robot and caregiver as well as care receipient, then perhaps the caretaker will have time for a respite and personal down time.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

UTA is also ranked by <i>U.S. News and World Report </i>as the top public university in the nation for graduating students with the lowest average student debt.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area boasts a population of more than 7.1 million people, and the average resident is about 35 years old. The University contributes to the Texas economy and North Texas by providing a number of education options to the workforce interested in retraining, pursuing a degree, continuing education, distance learning or increased social mobility. The Brookings Institution recently ranked UTA among the top 25 &#x201C;leader&#x201D; universities in the U.S. for providing high social mobility and high levels of impactful research, empowering students to pursue advanced careers while maintaining low student debt.</p>\n<p>While North Texas is the fastest growing metropolitan area in the U.S., only a third of residents over the age of 25 have an undergraduate or advanced degree. UTA is contributing to a more educated workforce with innovative education opportunities for adult learners, including the <a href=\"https://web-ded.uta.edu/wconnect/ace/index.asp\">Division for Enterprise Development</a> which focuses on improving employability and enhancing job skills for North Texans already in the workforce, providing certificates and professional accreditation. Strong partnerships with community colleges also ensure a seamless transfer of credits and direct pathways to degrees, offering customized advising, tailored orientation sessions and financial aid counseling.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;The traditional progression of a student from high school to four-year university to graduate school in a straight linear fashion is no longer the norm,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;Employment demands are also changing, requiring students to commit to a lifetime of learning, training and retraining. UTA recognizes this and it is why we provide educational opportunities to help our non-traditional students earn degrees and certifications that will positively impact their social mobility and contribution to the workforce.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Adult education is also a key focus at the state level, and the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.60x30tx.com/\">60x30TX strategic plan</a> sets forth a goal of 60 percent of Texans ages 25 to 34 having earned a certificate or degree by 2030. UTA contributes to this statewide effort, providing academic excellence, flexibility in programs and affordability. With the conferral of 12,749 degrees in the 2016-17 academic year, a 35 percent increase over the 9,470 degrees conferred during the 2013-14 academic year, UTA is focused not only on ensuring student success but also preparing a highly educated workforce and intelligentsia for Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I&apos;m proud that The University of Texas at Arlington is a clear leader in serving all students, regardless of age,&quot; said state Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Granbury, a member of the Senate Finance Committee. &quot;This designation also bodes well for veterans who have chosen to first serve their country, then pursue higher education after leaving the military. UTA understands its role as a partner in these educational and workforce development efforts.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA works closely with the corporate sector to develop degree programs that meet critical workforce needs such as a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in construction management introduced in the spring of 2017 and a master of science in construction engineering introduced in 2014. UTA&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation began offering five graduate nursing degrees online in spring 2017 to provide greater flexibility to adults returning to earn advanced degrees to advance their careers. Through a comprehensive set of offerings using face-to-face, hybrid and digital modalities UTA ensures that its offerings align with Texas&#x2019;s growing workforce needs at the bachelor, master and doctoral levels.</p>\n<p>In addition, recognizing that continuing and professional education is a critical component for our workforce to remain at a high level of effectiveness, UTA&#x2019;s Division for Enterprise Development offers diverse training and consulting programs that can lead to enhanced career opportunities.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;By 2030, over 60 percent of the available jobs in the Dallas region will require some form of postsecondary credential,&#x201D; said Angela Farley, senior vice president of education and workforce at the Dallas Regional Chamber. &#x201C;In order to meet the regional workforce needs of 60 percent of adult learners holding a post-secondary credential, they must have increased access to higher education and workforce training.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><i>Washington Monthly </i>developed its rankings through an analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Education&#x2019;s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and the College Board&#x2019;s Annual Survey of Colleges. The magazine measured seven metrics to determine a university&#x2019;s ability to serve adult learners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ease of transfer</li>\n<li>flexibility of programs</li>\n<li>services available for adult learners</li>\n<li>size of adult learner population</li>\n<li>earnings potential for graduates</li>\n<li>student loan repayment rates</li>\n<li>tuition and fees</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>U.S. News and World Report</i> ranks UTA as one of the top campuses in the nation for ethnic diversity. <i>Diverse: Issues in Higher Education</i> lists UTA as No. 1 in Texas for the number of bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees awarded to African-American students and No. 21 in the U.S. for bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees conferred to all minority students.</p>\n"

UTA is ranked by <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report </i>as the top public university in the nation for graduating students with the lowest average student debt, and the university ensures military connected students are not in danger of being dropped from classes should they experience a delay receiving funds.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Having top-down support is critical and Dr. Karbhari sets a clear example that faculty and staff follow,&#x201D; Kumm said. &#x201C;UTA cares about our student veterans, current military members and the families of both.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA was also recently ranked by <i>Washington Monthly</i> as the top four-year university in Texas for serving learners over the age of 25.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Incredible things are going on at UTA to ensure the success of our veterans and their families, whose sacrifices cannot be overstated,&#x201D; said state Rep. Trent Ashby, R-Lufkin. &#x201C;Helping veterans achieve degrees after they leave the military is important for the economy and workforce in Texas, and UTA is a clear leader in these efforts.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>According to <i>Military Times</i>, its 2018 rankings were more competitive than ever. <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/education-transition/rankings/2017/11/20/methodology-military-times-best-colleges-2018/\"><i>Military Times</i>&#x2019; methodology</a> included an analysis of responses to a rigorous survey of institutions as well as data from the U.S. Departments of Education, Defense and Veterans Affairs to measure schools&#x2019; culture, quality and outcomes, policies, student support and affordability.</p>\n<p>The Military Friendly rankings rated UTA high for culture and commitment, as the university fosters a culture of collaboration, service and philanthropy. UTA rated high for admission and orientation, a measure of UTA&#x2019;s efforts to recruit veterans and help them assimilate to the rigors and expectations of academic life. The university also scored high for academic policies and compliance.</p>\n<p>Accounting and finance double major Kendall Gillett, who completed a tour of duty in Afghanistan during her six years in the army, recognized UTA&#x2019;s efforts to help veterans transition from the military into the college environment.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It makes me extremely proud to be part of a university that cares&#xA0;about&#xA0;its veteran population and provides so many resources to ensure that our time at UTA is efficient and&#xA0;enjoyable,&#x201D; Gillett said. &#x201C;It is an honor to call myself a Maverick Veteran.&#x201D;</p>\n"

Rose said that fear that still drives U.S. disability policy today.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Today, approximately 70 percent of people with disabilities are unemployed, due in large part to discrimination and persistent barriers. Ensuring that students with disabilities graduate from college is one of the best ways to prevent unemployment and poverty, but many don&#x2019;t graduate,&#x201D; she added.</p>\n<p>UTA is one of the nation&#x2019;s leading institutions in helping students with disabilities gain access to educational opportunities. UTA was home to one of the country&#x2019;s first organizations for students with disabilities and was the first university in the United States to offer full-ride scholarships for athletes in adapted sports. Currently, UTA boasts to two pre-eminent wheelchair basketball teams.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/sarah-rose.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Sarah Rose is an associate professor of history and directs UTA&apos;s minor in disability studies.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Rose directs UTA&#x2019;s disability studies minor, the first such program in the south and one of only about 30 in the nation. Rose is currently advising institutions such as Yale University and The University of Texas at Austin as they consider establishing similar programs.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Rosie and I congratulate UTA for its historic impact in this important field,&#x201D; said Mike Moncrief, former County Judge, Texas state senator, state representative and Fort Worth Mayor. &#x201C;Dr. Rose is a true leader in disability studies. Her research shows us that investing in accessibility can make dreams of going to college and employment not only achievable goals, but a reality.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Currently, 70 students from more than 20 departments and majors are enrolled in UTA&#x2019;s disability studies minor. Participants are required to complete a 120-hour internship with a community partner and complete a capstone essay. Students intern in fields such as universal design, independent living, accessibility policy, disability rights law, disability history and adapted sports.</p>\n<p>One intern created procedures for identifying and paging deaf patients after discovering a deaf woman had been in labor for several hours in an emergency waiting room. She also convinced hospitals in Arlington to expand access to American Sign Language interpretation.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Of the 22 students who have already graduated from the minor, nine are employed in fields such as autism education, adapted sports, accessible technology, disability-related research, special education and rehabilitation. The others are either enrolled in or applying to graduate school.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;More than 60 percent of the students in the program have disabilities themselves. Their success shows how an accessible campus as well as mentoring, internships and links to the community can expand opportunities for the 20 percent of Americans who have disabilities,&#x201D; Rose said.</p>\n<p>Rose and Trevor Engel, the disability studies adviser and a 2016 graduate of the minor, jointly curated the &#x201C;Building a Barrier-Free Campus&#x201D; exhibit recently on display at the Texas State Capitol, The University of Texas at Austin&#x2019;s Perry-Caste&#xF1;eda Library and at the Lex Frieden Employment Awards hosted by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The exhibit also is&#xA0;<a href=\"http://library.uta.edu/barrier-freecampus/\">accessible in digital format</a>.</p>\n<p>In 2016, UTA Libraries debuted the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://library.uta.edu/txdisabilityhistory/\">Texas Disability History Collection website</a>, which features digitized documents, videos, images and oral histories from the Libraries&#x2019; groundbreaking collection, which was the first in the Southwest. The website was funded through a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to the Texas State Library and Archives Commission and received the Society of American Archivists&#x2019; Diversity Award for 2017.</p>\n<p>In a statement proclaiming October Persons with Disabilities History and Awareness Month, the Governor&#x2019;s Committee on People with Disabilities released a statement recognizing UTA&#x2019;s significant contributions to the field of disability studies. &#x201C;There is no better place to learn about the story of Texas and Texans with disabilities&#x2019; role in our state&#x2019;s rich history than The University of Texas at Arlington,&#x201D; the statement said.</p>\n"

The two bacteria showed a capacity to degrade toluene and chloroform, opening up the possibility that they can be potentially used in the bioremediation of spills.</p>\n<p>The CLEAR Lab also recently produced a new textbook with international multimedia publishing group Elsevier entitled, <i>&#x201C;Advances in Chemical Pollution, Environmental Management and Protection: Environmental Issues Concerning Hydraulic Fracturing</i>,&#x201D; which covers a broad range of topics pertaining to the environmental, societal, economical and human health implications of unconventional oil and gas development.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Collectively, the methods that we&#x2019;ve developed through these new studies allow us to quantify more than 2,500 different bacterial species simultaneously in any given sample. This, coupled with some of the best management practices that we&#x2019;ve outlined in our new textbook, will allow us to contribute to improving the environmental stewardship of unconventional oil and gas development, particularly with respect to the recycling of produced wastes,&#x201D; said Zacariah Hildenbrand, Chief Scientific Officer at Inform Environmental LLC and major contributor to CLEAR.</p>\n<p>This research links to the theme of global environmental impact within UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions|Global Impact</a>.</p>\n"

The project is entitled &#x201C;A Novel Wavelet Neurovascular Bundle for Detection of Injury in Neonatal Encephalopathy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Birth asphyxia, or an infant&#x2019;s deprivation of oxygen, is a global problem in clinical neonatal care. According to Liu&#x2019;s published report last year, 4 million newborns worldwide are affected annually, of which 1 million die and another 1 million are left with disabilities.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;To advance our understanding of who is at risk for brain injury immediately after birth, we need to merge expertise with a multidisciplinary team of physiologists and bioengineers, and indeed we are fortunate to have such a stellar team within the UT system,&#x201D; Chalak said.</p>\n<p>The clinical team science is led by Chalak, who also is a neonatal brain injury researcher and associate professor of pediatrics at UTSW, and includes Professor Rong Zhang, an expert in autoregulation methodologies at UTSW, as well as Liu and her former research associate, Fenghua Tian, who have all the expertise needed for adapting the use of the wavelet analysis in sick newborns.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We want to be able to give doctors the most reliable, quickest information to better treat these sick babies,&#x201D; said Liu, who also is an adjunct faculty member for UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering. &#x201C;Our optical brain imaging system uses near infrared light and detects non-invasively cerebral blood oxygenation and blood flow across multiple brain regions simultaneously. Such regional brain oxygenation parameters, when being combined with other vital recordings, will give physicians real-time information needed to proceed with life-saving treatment for babies experiencing encephalopathy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The key responsibility of Liu&#x2019;s group for this project rests on the novel adaption and further advances of wavelet coherence analysis or WCA, which was originally developed for atmospheric and oceanic sciences.</p>\n<p>WCA involves complex mathematics and computational steps. This is why Dr. Chalak from UTSW relies on Liu and her team for quantification of coherence factors between several neurophysiological and vital parameters, such as neurovascular wavelet analysis.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Such coherence factors may serve as bio-markers in the near future for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for sick babies,&#x201D; Liu said. &#x201C;The real-time monitoring lets doctors act more quickly. Of course, the ultimate goal is to save those babies&#x2019; lives.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Currently, Liu said treatment for neonatal encephalopathy is to lower the baby&#x2019;s temperature by using cooling blankets as the standard treatment, but only about 50 percent of the babies treated with a cooling blanket benefit.</p>\n<p>So, the combination of a portable brain imaging system with advances of WCA Liu is developing will help clinicians determine when the treatment should be initiated.</p>\n<p>The neurovascular wavelet analysis is innovative as it integrates multidisciplinary physiological and computational approaches to allow measurements of cerebral&#xA0;hemodynamics at the bedside.</p>\n<p>Michael Cho, chair of the UTA Bioengineering Department, said such collaborations with UT Southwestern drives the university&#x2019;s research portfolio into the health care realm.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s exciting work that Dr. Liu is doing,&#x201D; Cho said. &#x201C;To develop new technology that will help the babies of the world must be extremely satisfying. Dr. Liu&#x2019;s research answers the call of one of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan initiatives &#x2013; health and the human condition.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Liu, a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and a member of the UTA Academy of Distinguished Scholars, joined UTA&#x2019;s College of Engineering in 1996 and has secured more than $13 million as principal investigator or co-PI in research funding during her career. Her work has focused on medical instrumentation and imaging, minimally invasive and noninvasive spectroscopy and imaging of tissue, optical diffuse imaging for cancer prognosis, and brain activities.</p>\n<p>Last year, she and colleagues published groundbreaking research in Nature&#x2019;s Scientific Reports after years of studying neural abnormality or deficiencies of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder using near-infrared brain imaging.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Those discontinuities may evolve into structural damage in the form of cracks and delamination or composite layer splitting.</p>\n<p>X-ray CT has proven to be the only 3D industrial nondestructive inspection which has reliable micro resolution and allows for automated interpretation of the inspection results including the listed flaws. However, the current micro-focus CT technology is based on full scanning or 360 degrees around the object, which limits the technology to small cross sections and prevents accommodation of large structures.</p>\n<p>Even small objects, which can be scanned in the existing micro-CT facilities, sometimes do not allow for sufficient magnification of the microstructure during the full scanning. However, available limited-angle reconstructions lose definition and often become erroneous during one-sided inspections.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We believe that to advance composite aircraft structural certification, the analysis must capture manufacturing complexity and variability of flight-critical components and structure,&#x201D; Makeev said. &#x201C;Recent improvement in computing power and advances in X-ray CT reconstruction make it possible to develop high-resolution, one-sided CT inspection technology breaking through the object size limits of X-ray CT. It also offers the long-sought automation for composite aircraft structures.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Erian Armanios, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said Makeev&#x2019;s work answers the call of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020 for Bold Solutions.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Inspection of large composite components in a single run addresses a timely and critical need,&#x201D; Armanios said.&#xA0; &#x201C;Dr. Makeev&#x2019;s research provides CT software solutions that can combine high degree of automation with high degree of accuracy &#x2013; key end user requirements.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The U.S. Army and helicopter industry are facing the challenge of replacing more than 6,300 military vertical lift aircraft.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Makeev received a separate $600,000 grant from Boeing to assess durability and damage tolerance of composite structures for composite airframe life extension.</p>\n<p>Makeev has shouldered many research projects with companies that are especially focused on composite materials and structures.&#xA0;He has current or past grants with Boeing, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, Sikorsky Aircraft and Bell Helicopter Textron.</p>\n<p>During his six-year tenure at UTA, Makeev has been conducting pioneering theoretical and experimental work sponsored by the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and aerospace industry at an average rate of $1 million per year in external funding.

Next-generation gene sequencing techniques have revealed that thousands of lncRNA are associated with various types of cancers.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is creating expertise in this specific niche cancer research area, where we are competing with other nationally and internationally recognized cancer research institutions,&#x201D; said Subhrangsu Mandal, UTA associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry and lead author of the study. &#x201C;Our highly-cited study from two years ago linking the lncRNA molecule HOTAIR with breast, hepatocellular, colorectal, pancreatic, lung and ovarian cancers established us as a forerunner in this burgeoning research field.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Genome-wide association studies of tumor samples have identified a large number of lncRNA associated with various types of cancer. Alterations in lncRNA expression and their mutations promote tumorigenesis and metastasis.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Many lncRNAs are stable in body fluids and detectable in plasma or urine of cancer patients, with levels indicative of the severity of the disease,&#x201D; Mandal added. &#x201C;These factors make lncRNA an attractive choice for application as non-invasive biomarkers, and clinical trials are already underway for the use of specific lncRNA to detect prostate cancer.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>As lncRNA expression levels correlate with tumor aggressiveness and different stages of the cancer, these molecules are also potential targets for personalized cancer therapies, and &#x201C;though the field is still in its infancy, we are also looking at using lncRNA to predict cancer prognosis and patient outcomes,&#x201D; Mandal said.</p>\n<p>UTA researchers have published multiple studies in this field, with one earlier this year this year that linked low oxygen levels to the growth of cancer cells in people with a specific lncRNA called HOTAIR.

Hereford University Center on the UTA campus.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This year&#x2019;s forum will feature a half day of thoughtful discussions about entrepreneurship by scholars and industry experts.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Cawthon, dean of the <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/libarts/\">College of Liberal Arts</a>, says while many people have ideas with the potential for success, only a tiny fraction have been able to develop those ideas into thriving businesses.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is only by moving from thought to action that people are able to make a difference in the real world,&#x201D; Cawthon said. &#x201C;Liberal arts graduates have a great base of training for turning an idea into something tangible. Whether in business, research or creative projects, we tend to understand what comes after the spark.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The Festival of Ideas forum is made possible through UTA alumnus Mustaque Ahmed whose contribution helped the College of Liberal Arts launch its Festival of Ideas Global Research Institute. Ahmed&#x2019;s vision for the annual festival was to create an outlet for students and the community to explore cultural and academic ideas together while highlighting impressive research initiatives within UTA and the College of Liberal Arts.</p>\n<p>In accordance with UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020 <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions l Global Impact</a>, the university focuses on transformational research in the areas of health and the human condition, sustainable urban communities, global environmental impact and data-driven discovery.</p>\n<p>UTA has proven itself to be a haven for budding entrepreneurs. Over the past five years, more than 100 patents have been issued to UTA faculty and more than 25 technologies licensed to outside companies. Some 60 faculty and students are currently working on start-ups and more than 20 companies are developing around&#xA0;UTA.</p>\n<p>The festival is expected to attract more than 300 attendees, including 180 students from the Arlington school district&#x2019;s Dan Dipert&#xA0;Career and Technical Center and nearly 70 students from International Leadership of Texas.</p>\n<p>The event includes four guest speakers who will give brief, dynamic addresses. There will be an opportunity for audience questions and interaction. Attendees also will visit interactive displays and entrepreneur-themed information tables presented by university organizations such as Pitch UTA, Wild Pony Editions and the Art Cart, known as cART.&#xA0;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The guest speakers include Ryan Musselman<b>,</b> president of OpTic Gaming; Chris Christian, vice chairman and owner of the WNBA Dallas Wings as well as a songwriter and record producer; G.

I think it&#x2019;s appropriate to share the idea of making music accessible forever with the community as part of the Festival of Ideas,&#x201D; Arditi said.</p>\n<p>CoLA&#x2019;s Festival of Ideas will encourage creative students to explore entrepreneurship without fear, Cawthon said. &#x201C;I want more emerging scholars to feel comfortable saying, &#x2018;I think I have a solution to a problem no matter how big or small,&#x2019;&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Maybe that spark will be elevated locally, within the community, with bottom-up experimentation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The festival is free and open to the public.

The program is named after Ronald McNair, a NASA astronaut who was killed in the 1986 space shuttle Challenger disaster.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We want our McNair Scholars to graduate with their bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in a timely manner and go to graduate school. But we don&#x2019;t want them to stop with a master&#x2019;s degree,&#x201D; said Joan Reinhardt, director of the McNair Scholars Program at UTA. &#x201C;We want them to obtain their Ph.D. degrees and enter academia to create more diversity among those who are teaching or conducting research at the college or university level, which is a benefit for them and our country overall.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Only 161 universities in the United States are selected to host McNair Scholars programs. The UTA chapter was established in 1990, making it one of the oldest programs in existence.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/mcnair-research.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>McNair Scholar Esther Ruth Kentish</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>McNair Scholars participate in special research internships working closely with faculty mentors during their junior or senior years to expose them to the rigors and demands of graduate school.</p>\n<p>Examples of research conducted by UTA&#x2019;s McNair Scholars in just the last year include organ regeneration in snakes, music interpretation theory and cancer cell growth. McNair Scholars come from all disciplines, but there is a particular emphasis on recruiting those studying in science, technology, engineering and math.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As a first-generation college student, I started at UTA knowing little about college and even less about graduate school,&#x201D; said Arianna Gomez, a UTA senior studying psychology. &#x201C;The McNair Scholars program changed everything. I would not be so sure of my future had I not been a McNair Scholar.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Gomez is currently applying to graduate school and plans to obtain a doctorate degree.</p>\n<p>Many graduates of UTA&#x2019;s McNair Scholars program already have obtained their doctoral degrees and are now working at colleges and universities or in research posts across the country.</p>\n<p>Padmini Veerapen earned her doctorate from UTA is currently an assistant professor of mathematics at Tennessee Tech University. Sharon Lynn Eaves is an assistant professor of psychology at Stephen F. Austin State University and Diana Cervantes is currently a faculty member at UNT Health Science Center in Fort Worth and also the lead epidemiologist for the Texas Department of State Health Services in Arlington.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The McNair Scholars program at UTA allowed me to dare to believe that I might be able to go to graduate school and be successful,&#x201D; Veerapen said. &#x201C;As a kid growing up on the island of Mauritius, I never thought I could go this far. The UTA McNair Scholars program changed that and was a stepping stone toward all that I am now.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Eligible students must be U.S. citizens and either a low-income and first-generation undergraduate or a member of an underrepresented group in graduate education &#x2013; which means African American, Hispanic, Native American, Native Alaskan or Native Hawaiian.

Seongjin Noh, civil engineering research assistant professor, is a co-investigator on the project. External collaborators include Deltares USA, University of Massachusetts Amherst and the NWS Office of Water Prediction.</p>\n<p>Seo will use high-resolution data from the UTA-hosted Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere, or CASA, radar system, LiDAR-derived digital elevation model and water level sensors deployed in DFW by his team. To create hyper-resolution images, he will nest the hyper-resolution model within the larger NWM over the Arlington-Grand Prairie area.

After some time, bridges deteriorate or may get damaged, and a University of Texas at Arlington researcher is working with the Texas Department of Transportation to inspect, evaluate and monitor bridges to ensure their safety for years to come.</p>\n<p>Nur Yazdani, a professor in UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/engineering/civil/\">Department of Civil Engineering</a>, recently was awarded a three-year, $735,133 contract to inspect and evaluate new and existing concrete bridge components using non-destructive methods. He will also determine the true load capacity of bridges to ensure that the posted capacities represent what the bridges are capable of supporting.</p>\n<p>According to Yazdani, most bridges are designed to last 50 years or longer, but many factors, such as cracking or spalling concrete, deterioration of the steel reinforcement inside or design or construction issues, may reduce their capacities and useful lives.</p>\n<p>Yazdani will use non-destructive techniques, or NDT, including ground-penetrating radar, thermal imaging and ultrasound tomography, either alone or in combination, to test 30 bridges in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. These methods will detect cracks, corrosion, damage or other issues without harming the bridge, and allow Yazdani and TxDOT experts to quickly and accurately determine the best course of action to remedy any deficiencies through repair, strengthening or replacement.</p>\n<p>To determine load capacity, Yazdani and his team will use a computer model to conduct a multi-parameter study by manipulating materials, span length and other key measurements. They will then conduct a real-life test where they measure a bridge, close the highway for short periods of time and park a loaded truck on the bridge. They will measure the bridge again to see how much it flexed due to the weight of the truck and compare those results to the model&#x2019;s prediction. If the numbers don&#x2019;t match, it indicates a problem that TxDOT can then address.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is really a cost issue. Our research will help the state save money and ensure that Texas bridges are safe. Any time you can save money without compromising safety, it&#x2019;s desirable,&#x201D; Yazdani said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Making safer structures makes transportation safer and benefits the community as well. If a bridge suffers a catastrophic failure, there&#x2019;s a huge cost in terms of financial, time and social losses, so anything we can do to make it easier to inspect bridges and quickly address issues beforehand is important.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Yazdani and his team have been testing the performance of a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer wrapping for future bridge repairs through another $598,953 existing contract from TxDOT. Already in use in about 25 state highway departments including TxDOT, the laminate is less than one-half millimeter thick and stronger than steel. If concrete deterioration or damage is detected, workers prepare the concrete surface, spread epoxy glue over the surface and the CFRP laminate, then place the wrap on the glued surface. The performance of the CFRP wrapping is being investigated through NDT methods in the laboratory and also on full-scale highway bridges.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The CFRP laminate doesn&#x2019;t corrode, has a high durability, and whatever member strength was lost due to damage/deterioration is more than regained by the laminate application. It is also easily installed and doesn&#x2019;t affect the bridge height or clearance for any vehicles passing below. If it performs as expected, this could make repair and maintenance of bridges much easier, less costly and durable,&#x201D; Yazdani said.</p>\n<p>Yazdani&#x2019;s research is one example of the research in the area of sustainable urban communities, one of the themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020 <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions |Global Impact</a>, said Ali Abolmaali, professor and Tseng Huang Chair of the Department of Civil Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Bridges and overpasses are key elements of the highway system in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Structural issues that force closures cause massive disruptions to transportation and commerce. Dr. Yazdani&#x2019;s work will help TxDOT identify and correct problems before they get to that point, keeping our highways open and flowing smoothly,&#x201D; Abolmaali said.</p>\n"

It is Puppala&#x2019;s first patent. He received it with his collaborator, Xiong Yu of Case Western Reserve University.</p>\n<p>Puppala&#x2019;s algorithm works with an integrated moisture sensor and a time domain reflectometry, or TDR, probe. The sensor, which has bender elements, is integrated with the time domain reflectometry strip. This integrated sensor is placed in the soil and measures the soil stiffness and moisture content when the soil begins to heave. When stabilizing soils with chemicals, which is typical in road construction, soil stiffness generally increases over time. However, in soils with sulfates the reverse is true because the sulfates begin to have chemical reactions that impede positive stabilization reactions. Many times, stabilized soils shift or bulge at the surface, which is known as heaving.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It can take months for issues to become apparent, and at that point it can be very problematic and cost states millions of dollars for repairing heaved roads. With this method, engineers can test a section during construction on sulfate-rich soils and detect a loss of soil stiffness within one to two days, potentially saving millions of dollars by choosing other methods that may work best for these soils,&#x201D; Puppala said.</p>\n<p>The research that led to the patent was funded by an Innovations Deserving Exploratory Analysis, or IDEA, grant from the National Academy of Sciences&#x2019; National Cooperative Highway Research Program.</p>\n<p>The work is an example of UTA&#x2019;s commitment to fostering&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/communities.php\">sustainable urban communities</a>, a theme of the university&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Peter Crouch, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Puppala has long been a leader in soil research and being awarded a patent is a crowning achievement in his career,&#x201D; said Crouch. &#x201C;With the anticipated increase in government infrastructure funding, this device will be an important tool for those wishing to avoid delays and cost overruns due to poor soils.&#x201D;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">--<em>Written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n"

Such processing has, until now, worked only for one optical beam at a time because the nonlinear-optical effects also cause unwanted inter-beam interaction, or crosstalk, when multiple light beams are present.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption400\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/vasilyev-lab.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Michael Vasilyev, left, a UTA electrical engineering professor, speaks with one of his graduate students.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>An&#xA0;<span><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00874-0\">article published in the prestigious&#xA0;<i>Nature Communications</i>&#xA0;journal</a></span>, by the research group of Michael Vasilyev, an electrical engineering professor at UTA, in collaboration with Taras I. Lakoba, a mathematics professor at UVM, detailed an experimental demonstration of an optical medium in which multiple beams of light can autocorrect their own shapes without affecting one another.</p>\n<p>This work, funded by the National Science Foundation, enables simultaneous nonlinear-optical processing of multiple light beams by a single device without converting them to electrical form, opening the way for this technology to reach its full multi-Terabit per second potential, resulting in cheaper and more energy efficient high-speed internet communications.</p>\n<p>Currently, to eliminate the noise accumulated during light propagation in optical communication links, telecom carriers must resort to frequent optoelectronic regeneration, where they convert optical signals to electrical via fast photodetectors, process them with silicon-based circuitry, and then convert the electrical signals back to optical, using lasers followed by electro-optic modulators. Since each optical fiber can carry over a hundred different signals at various wavelengths, known as wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), such an optoelectronic regeneration needs to be done separately for each wavelength, making regenerators large, expensive and inefficient consumers of power.</p>\n<p>An attractive alternative to this is processing the optical signal directly, without converting it to electrical and back. In particular, the speed of light propagating in a transparent medium can be slightly modified by a change in the light intensity. This is a manifestation of a nonlinear-optical effect known as &#x201C;self-phase modulation&#x201D; or SPM. If light contains both signal and noise, the SPM can help clean the signal from noise by scattering the noise energy into frequencies well outside the signal band, from where the noise can be easily removed by a filter. When applied to light containing useful data, this SPM-enabled noise-removal operation is called &#x201C;all-optical regeneration,&#x201D; which can result in optical auto-correction of the signals carrying hundred times faster data rates than what can be processed electronically.</p>\n<p>However, the adoption of the all-optical regeneration in communication systems has been hindered by its inability to work with WDM signals. This is because in the presence of multiple signal beams, or WDM channels, the desired SPM is always accompanied by two undesirable effects: cross-phase modulation, where one channel&#x2019;s intensity modifies propagation speed of another channel, and four-wave mixing, where interaction of several channels leads to interference with other channels.</p>\n<p>In their published article, Vasilyev and colleagues report experimental demonstration of a novel group-delay-managed nonlinear-optical medium, where strong SPM effect is achieved without such inter-channel interference. Splitting a conventional nonlinear medium, such as an optical fiber, into several short sections separated by special periodic-group-delay filters yields a medium in which all frequency components of the same WDM channel travel with the same speed, ensuring strong SPM. Different WDM channels travel with different speeds, which dramatically suppresses any inter-channel interaction.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our new nonlinear medium has allowed us to demonstrate simultaneous all-optical regeneration of 16 WDM channels by a single device, and this number has only been limited by the logistical constraints of our laboratory&#x201D; Vasilyev said. &#x201C;This experiment opens the opportunities to scale the number of channels to over a hundred without increasing the cost, all in a book-sized device.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The multi-channel regenerator could even potentially shrink to the size of a matchbox in the future if the nonlinear-optical medium could be implemented on a microchip.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This breakthrough is an example of how UTA researchers can positively impact the physical and economic well-being of society in the area of&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\"><span>data-driven&#xA0;discovery</span></a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<span><a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/impact.php\">global environmental impact</a></span>, themes in UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\"><span>Bold Solutions | Global Impact</span></a>,&#x201D; said Jonathan Bredow, professor and chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering in UTA&apos;s College of Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Previous efforts to implement nonlinear-optical processing, such as regeneration, failed to make an impact because there was no advantage to employing them over electrical signals due to the inability to use more than one channel. Now that Dr. Vasilyev&#x2019;s group has overcome that obstacle, there are tremendous new possibilities for faster, more efficient transmission of messages,&#x201D; Bredow said.&#xA0;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>--Written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n"

Ann McFadyen, a UTA associate professor of strategic management, conducted the review earlier this year. It comes at a time when noteworthy sexual harassment and assault incidents have permeated all aspects of American society.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our current examination of the evidence suggests that sexual harassment is a continuing occupational problem,&#x201D; Quick said. &#x201C;Have we made progress? Yes, there has been progress on some fronts but not on others and the problem has morphed, becoming more complicated for a variety of reasons found in the current data.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Society and the workplace continue to struggle with the very definition of sexual harassment, which limits the ability to develop effective strategies in the workplace.</p>\n<p>Plus, McFadyen said that the workforce is changing.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Sexual harassment in the workplace is costly, not just to the organization,&#x201D; McFadyen said. &#x201C;The behavior impacts the victim, the aggressor, bystanders, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders in terms of tarnished reputations and trust, disengaged employees, decreased commitment, turnover, depression, stress, eating and other health disorders and in extreme cases bodily harm, even death.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>She said that the recent publicity regarding sexual harassment is a signal of the beginning of a revolutionary change in the workplace demanding a different type of training.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Training not only for leaders and management but employees at all ranks, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders,&#x201D; McFadyen said. &#x201C;Successful leaders and management of organizations cannot afford to simply maintain the status quo.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Both believe that there is a real need from a public heath perspective to know more about the aggressors&#x2019; use of power in sexual harassment cases.</p>\n<p>The two professors believe that if the workplace is equipped with this information, surveillance indicators and systems can be put into place to address this preventable occupational health problem.</p>\n<p>Antonio Puente, the American Psychological Association president, used the Quick-McFadyen report in a letter to members last month.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Sexual harassment in the workplace is a significant occupational health psychology problem,&#x201D; Puente said. &#x201C;Psychological research has offered understanding into the causes of workplace harassment, as well as some strategies for preventing or reducing it. However, there is limited research regarding the characteristics of harassers, which makes it difficult to predict who will do it and where and when it might happen. What we do know is that harassers tend to lack a social conscience and engage in manipulative, immature, irresponsible and exploitative behaviors.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He said organizations need to be proactive in establishing policies prohibiting sexual harassment, raising employee awareness, establishing reporting procedures and educating employees about these policies.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;More research is needed to identify the antecedents to harassment that will help employees and managers identify and respond appropriately,&#x201D; Puentes said.</p>\n<p>Quick and McFadyen&#x2019;s previous 2014 article on dangerous employees looked at the broader issue of psychological health in the workplace and the consequences when employees become really unhealthy, which includes suicide, homicide, assaults and workplace violence.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>McFadyen&#x2019;s research examines strategic implications of knowledge creation, exchange networks and strategic alliances on performance.

Moore&#x2019;s character finds relief using the Texas Bullet Train. The film won in the category of animation excellence.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A few years ago, I was on a family vacation in Japan and we rode a bullet train. I was a big fan,&#x201D; Moore said. &#x201C;When I heard about this contest, I was excited to use my own experience as my inspiration. I loved using my own style to express myself while helping a company.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Texas Central put out a call for university students in Texas along the train&#x2019;s proposed route to produce original short films, 1 to 3 minutes in length, which answered the question, &#x201C;Why do you believe the Texas Bullet Train would be beneficial for Texas and Texans?&#x201D; The work could be animated, live action or a combination of the two. UTA submitted 11 entries, five of which were named finalists.</p>\n<p>Moore will receive $5,000 and UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/communication/\">Department of Communication</a> will receive $2,000 for Moore&#x2019;s winning effort.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I incorporated this contest into my curriculum for the semester because I knew it was an excellent opportunity for students to experience the process of producing a video for a client from start to finish,&#x201D; said LaDonna Aiken, broadcast lecturer at UTA and Moore&#x2019;s mother. While Moore is not one of the students in her corporate video class, Aiken did act as his faculty adviser for this project.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/winning-video-bullet-train3.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;All of the students got a taste for how to listen to a client&#x2019;s needs and then use their branding, logos and messaging to accomplish their goal,&#x201D; Aiken said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m proud of the work they did and the recognition they received.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The videos were judged on social media and also by a panel of industry experts, including Janis Burklund, Dallas film commissioner, and Rick Ferguson, Houston Film Commission vice president and executive director.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Teams from Texas A&amp;M University won in the categories of live action excellence and creativity.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We were quite impressed with the level of creativity and excellence displayed in all of the entries,&#x201D; said Rebecca Cowle, Texas Central outreach manager.&#xA0; &#x201C;Students are among our most enthusiastic supporters. They have a direct feel for the kind of innovation and technology that the bullet train will bring to the state, and clearly recognize how it will increase the value of their personal time and improve quality of life. We immensely enjoyed seeing the films they produced, and are inspired by their creative vision for the Texas Bullet Train and the future of Texas.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>This is the second Texas Bullet Train competition a UTA student has won. Julia Green, a graduate student in The College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs <a href=\"../../2016/12/bullet-train-design-competition.php\">won the 2016 station design competition</a>.</p>\n<p>Moore&#x2019;s winning entry is an example of the editing and communication skills he learned as a student in UTA&#x2019;s broadcast program. Audio production skills gained while working at UTA Radio previously earned him a first place Pinnacle Award from the College Media Association and the grand prize for Best Public Service Announcement/Promo at South Central Broadcasting Society in October. While most of the other entries in the Texas Bullet Train competition were created by teams, Moore worked alone.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I really enjoyed getting deep into the spirit of animation. While I&#x2019;ve been animating things since I was 16, and drawing even before that, here at UTA, I have honed my skills and learned to love and appreciate the craft and how it can be used in a variety of ways,&#x201D; Moore said.</p>\n<p>Moore expects to graduate in spring 2019 and plans to pursue a career in animation or video editing.&#xA0;</p>\n"

Alcorn, director of the Veterans Business Outreach Center, said veterans can access a full day of entrepreneurial content at the symposium and fair. The UTA VBOC is only one of two in Texas and one of 20 in the United States.</p>\n<p>The U.S. Small Business Administration awarded $500,0000 in funding in 2016 for the UTA College of Business Veterans Business Outreach Center to offer educational, training and consulting services to veterans who are starting or growing a business in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are delivering small business resources to empower prospective and existing veteran-owned small businesses,&#x201D; Alcorn said. &#x201C;We connect veterans who could soon open their own business or franchise to the network of resources available to start or grow a business beyond the battlefield.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Resource partners at the event include the U.S. Small Business Administration, mentors from SCORE or Service Corps of Retired Executives, Small Business Development Center advisers, Procurement Technical Assistance Center counselors, SBA approved lenders and more.</p>\n<p>Some of the exhibitors and vendors lending assistance include: VetFran, FranNet, 7-Eleven, Veterans Administration, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Texas Veterans Commission, Women Veterans&#x2019; Enterprise Center, Texas Workforce Commission, PeopleFund, Accion, LiftFund, city of Dallas, city of Arlington, Alliance Lending, Veteran Franchise Center, Legacy Bank, TMAC and Momentum Texas.</p>\n<p>Alcorn said the number of agencies and companies attending the event will help serve as a one-stop shop for veterans looking to take that next step in the business world.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The strength of the event, though, is the networking that takes place between veterans and representatives from these organizations and companies, as well as among the veterans themselves,&#x201D; Alcorn said. &#x201C;Veterans learn that even though they&#x2019;ve left the military, they can leverage the veteran business network to build a new life and a business beyond the battlefield. In sharing their experiences and best business practices, they learn from each other.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The event is free, and it includes a plenary breakfast and a plenary keynote luncheon.

Penson Endowed Professor of Clinical Health Psychology and director of UTA&#x2019;s Center of Excellence in Health &amp; Chronic Illness</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Researchers at The University of Texas at Arlington are focusing their attention on pain management in older adults, a segment of the population which presents a specific series of challenges to health providers.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Pain is prevalent and often undertreated among older adults,&#x201D; said Robert Gatchel, UTA Distinguished Professor of Psychology, Nancy P. and John G. Penson Endowed Professor of Clinical Health Psychology and director of UTA&#x2019;s Center of Excellence in Health &amp; Chronic Illness.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;With 20 percent of Americans expected to be 65 or older by 2030, the development of new and effective pain management strategies is a necessity, especially given that 75 percent of people in this age group have two or more chronic conditions such as heart disease, arthritis or diabetes, which complicate the taking of pain medications,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>In a new review paper published in the <a href=\"https://www.ecronicon.com/ecan/si/ECAN-01-SI-01.pdf\">EC Anesthesia Special Issue 2017</a>, Gatchel and UTA psychology doctoral student Kelley Bevers analyze the challenges of using opioids, anti-depressants, anti-inflammatory drugs and topical and injectable agents to treat pain among the elderly.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The side effects of opioids, such as nausea and dizziness, can lead to an increased risk and rate of falls and subsequent injury, particularly among the older population,&#x201D; Gatchel said. &#x201C;Older adults are also more prone to physical side effects from these drugs, such as liver and kidney problems, and need both careful evaluation and routine testing of organ function for follow-up care.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The review also analyzes concerns about using anti-depressants for pain relief among this population. Cognitive impairment such as dementia or Alzheimers can affect the adherence to and consistency of the consumption of anti-depressant medications among older populations. An erratic or sudden cessation of medication can lead to complications such as suicidal thoughts or behaviors, depression or mood imbalances. In addition, other medications that the patient may be taking such as steroids, hormonal supplements and anticonvulsants can exacerbate or worsen these depressive symptoms. Gatchel suggests that a thorough medical history needs to be considered prior to beginning antidepressant treatment among this patient group and detailed follow-up is needed.</p>\n<p>Another widely used pain medication group are non-steroidal anti-inflammatories sold under well-known brand names such as Advil, Motrin or Aleve. While these drugs are effective for treating musculoskeletal pain, they pose particular challenges for use in older adults, including drug interactions with certain medications such as aspirin and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, commonly used to treat depression, as well as increased risk of peptic ulcers and compromised organ function when taken over the long-term. Gastro-protective drugs can reduce the risk of ulcers and toxicity, but are currently only being prescribed in about 40 percent of older patients taking anti-inflammatories, according to a nationwide register-based study.</p>\n<p>Topical creams, transdermal patches or injectable medications are also available for those unable to take medications in pill form or who have an acute, localized pain. Topical creams can be effective for pain near the body surface such as superficial muscular pain but may not be sufficient to penetrate the body for other conditions. Gatchel&#x2019;s review explains that transdermal patches often demonstrate the same problem, though morphine can be administered in patch form allowing for a steady release and adsorption of the medication without the need for an intravenous setup or oral medications. Other medications are also available in injectable form, but are usually reserved for emergency situations.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Pain management in older adults is a complex and multi-faceted issue,&#x201D; Gatchel concludes. &#x201C;Older adults face unique challenges that can further complicate general concerns, so complete medical histories including current medications are essential for effective and safe pharmacotherapy. Each major medication group presents advantages and complications to pain management and must complement other medicinal needs, so thorough screening is essential.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Gatchel was awarded the American Psychological Foundation&#x2019;s 2017 Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Application of Psychology. His research is a clear example of UTA&#x2019;s focus on health and the human condition within the university&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020 <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions|Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

UTA is the largest public four-year university in Texas designated as an HSI and one of only 10 universities in the nation to achieve the designation of both HSI and R-1: Highest Research Activity in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.</p>\n<p>The HSI designation allowed UTA to become eligible for additional federal funding for initiatives aimed at expanding educational opportunities and increasing degree attainment rates among all students. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Education awarded UTA a highly competitive, five-year $2.62 million grant to enhance services and increase graduation and retention rates among lower-income and Hispanic students. Martinez-Cosio is the co-lead principal investigator on the grant with Carla Amaro-Jimenez, associate professor in UTA&#x2019;s College of Education and Jennifer Luken, director of UTA&#x2019;s TRiO-Student Support Services. The grant funds the UTA IDEAS Center &#x2013; for Innovation, Diversity, Excellence, Access and Success.</p>\n<p>The IDEAS Center is located in UTA&#x2019;s Central Library and offers access to support services for students in transition, particularly transfer students, veterans and those from underserved populations. The grant also provides funding for professional development of faculty members, exposing them to innovative methods of teaching to help them build connections with first-generation students.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;On days when I need a little mood boost, I stop in the IDEAS Center. I see students working with mentors and tutors, students brainstorming on white boards purchased with grant money and collaborating in groups using new spaces that we designed. It truly reaffirms why we do what we do at UTA,&#x201D; Martinez-Cosio said.</p>\n<p>Martinez-Cosio was born in Mexico and immigrated to San Diego with her parents when she was 10 years old. She loved to read and learn but had to work hard to overcome a language barrier. No one in her family had attended college, so Martinez-Cosio didn&#x2019;t plan to either, until a high school counselor suggested it. He helped her fill out an application to the University of California, San Diego, and she was accepted.</p>\n<p>To pay for tuition, Martinez-Cosio drove a school bus for disabled students in a nearby school district each morning and afternoon, and she squeezed in classes in between bus routes. Eventually, she earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree, a master&#x2019;s degree and a doctorate in sociology. Along the way she discovered her passion for community service and removing barriers to higher education. She says she is humbled by the award.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;One of UTA&#x2019;s greatest strengths is our diversity among both students and faculty. We want to continue to build upon this by attracting even more Latino and African American faculty members,&#x201D; Martinez-Cosio said. &#x201C;I sincerely thank Ford Motor Company for honoring the work we are doing, because I believe this will show students the impact you can make by going beyond a bachelor&#x2019;s degree. We want to encourage students from all backgrounds to earn a master&#x2019;s and a Ph.D. and return to campus and teach.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Martinez-Cosio&#x2019;s work exemplifies progress along UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>. Transforming the student experience by enhancing access and ensuring success is one of the plan&#x2019;s guiding aspirations.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s vitally important for our state to add more degree-holding citizens from all walks of life because that infuses an immense amount of knowledge and creativity into the workforce,&#x201D; said state Rep. Roberto Alonzo, D-Dallas. &#x201C;I commend UTA for the work it has done over the past few years to increase access to higher education for all Texans.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The 2017 North Texas Mujeres Legendarias Awards also recognized commercial real estate agent Amanda Moreno-Lake, artist and teacher Viola Delgado and co-founder of Sierra Shred Lucretia Lucio. Previous recipients from UTA include Liliana Perez-Nordtvedt, associate professor of marketing, and Minerva Cordero-Epperson, professor of mathematics and associate dean for academic affairs in the College of Science.&#xA0;</p>\n"

The program is offered on select college campuses nationwide and allows qualified veterans to receive free services such as counseling, mentoring, tutoring and academic instruction in core subject areas with the goal being to increase the rate at which veterans enroll in college and complete a degree.</p>\n<p>UTA has earned several designations honoring its commitment to serving military veterans. UTA is the No. 1 four-year university in Texas on the&#xA0;<i>Military Times</i>&#xA0;2017 &#x201C;Best for Vets: Colleges&#x201D; list. Victory Media designated UTA a &#x201C;Military Friendly&#x201D; university for 2017.&#xA0;<i>U.S. Veterans Magazine</i>&#xA0;designated UTA as one of the nation&#x2019;s top veteran-friendly schools in 2015. UTA also is home to the only Veterans Business Outreach Center in North Texas, which offers education, training and consulting services to veterans who are pursuing entrepreneurship.</p>\n<p>The federally funded Veterans Upward Bound program is awarded through a highly competitive grant application process. UTA&#x2019;s grant was renewed, in part, because of the program&#x2019;s demonstrated results since its inception in 2012.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s Veterans Upward Bound program has served more than 580 veterans in its five-year life.

The discovery could pave the way to the development of new treatments for cancer and some neurological diseases.</p>\n<p>Mitochondria are cell organs with multiple functions, including the production of cellular energy and the metabolism of amino acids and lipids, as well as the regulation of programmed cell death.</p>\n<p>When mitochondria are stressed by disease, toxins or infection, a signaling pathway is created whereby a protein enters the cell nucleus and binds to specific DNA sequences to unlock genes that help repair the mitochondria. This pathway is called the mitochondrial unfolded protein response or UPR<sup>mt.</sup></p>\n<p>&#x201C;We identified the protein ATFS-1 as the regulator of the UPR<sup>mt</sup> signaling pathway in <i>C. elegans, </i>a primitive worm that we study as it shares many characteristics with human biology. Recently ATF5 was found to encode a homologous protein in mammals, with similar mitochondrial and nuclear localization sequences,&#x201D; said Mark Pellegrino, UTA assistant professor of biology and lead author of the mini-review study in the <a href=\"http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2017/07/07/jbc.R117.791061\">Journal of Biological Chemistry</a> that included this research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The discovery of a clearer link between ATF5 and the UPR<sup>mt</sup> pathway in mammals could facilitate developing new therapies for diseases that result from mitochondrial dysfunction, including cancer,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>The relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer is not homogeneous. In certain cancers, mitochondria are dysfunctional, while others display even enhanced functions. In these cases, mitochondrial recovery programs must be active that help support balanced mitochondrial function and consequently the growth and proliferation of tumors. Growing evidence suggests that the UPR<sup>mt</sup> may be one recovery pathway.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;While the links are complex, some researchers have found that inhibiting ATF5 increases tumor cell death while having little or no effect on healthy cells, which supports our targeting the UPR<sup>mt</sup> pathway for anti-cancer therapies,&#x201D; Pellegrino said.</p>\n<p>Pellegrino joined UTA last year from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York with an $823,067 grant from The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas to study mitochondrial stress signaling in the context of cancer biology, part of which was used to fund this mini-review. His previous discovery that mitochondria are an important activator of innate immunity was published in the leading journal <i>Nature</i> in 2014.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My aim is to use the pathway that mitochondria employ to repair themselves to develop therapeutics not only for cancer but for other pathologies linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, such as neurological disease, which is still relatively unexplored,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>UTA has more than 30 faculty focused on cancer research and registered more than $4 million in research expenditures for cancer in the academic year 2016-2017. <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/01/Cancer%20release%20summary.php\">Cancer research</a> is an integral part of the University&#x2019;s focus on Health and the Human Condition, one of the four guiding themes put forth in UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions|Global Impact.</a></p>\n"

Cavallo is also a Distinguished University Professor of Science Education.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our master&#x2019;s students are all experienced teachers. We shift their focus away from lecturing to their students and prepare them to provide students experiences and activities that support deep-structured learning. Engaging students in direct experiences develops the reasoning, logic, and critical thinking skills they need to fully grasp complex concepts and processes.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The goal of the program is to educate teachers in what&#x2019;s known as the Learning Cycle/5E model of teaching &#x2013; engage, explore, explain, elaborate and evaluate.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We must be true to our own philosophies so teachers are fully and actively engaged in learning experiences,&#x201D; Cavallo said. &#x201C;The program is extremely interactive. Our students try teaching procedures and strategies they learn in their own classrooms, then come back and discuss their experiences. They share with teachers all over the country, some of whom might be in remote places. They collaborate, think about and talk about what teaching really is. Good teachers are those who always reflect on their teaching and gauge their students&#x2019; learning, while constantly thinking, &#x2018;How can I make their learning better?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s online master of education in curriculum and instruction programs are accredited by The National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education.</p>\n"

Andrews, Jr., The University of Texas at Arlington will establish an endowed chair to promote research, innovation and development of best practices in the general areas of automotive engineering and design, mechanical engineering, and the Formula SAE (FSAE) racing team.</p>\n<p>The Dr. Bob Woods Chair in Automotive Engineering Endowed by Paul E. Andrews, Jr. honors longtime UTA mechanical engineering professor and Formula SAE advisor Bob Woods.</p>\n<p>Andrews founded TTI, Inc., in 1971. The Fort Worth-based company celebrated its 45th anniversary in 2016 as the world&#x2019;s leading authorized distributor of passive, connector, electromechanical and discrete components for industrial, military, aerospace and consumer electronics manufacturers. TTI acquired Texas-based Mouser Electronics in 2000 and Andrews sold majority ownership of the company to Berkshire Hathaway in 2006.</p>\n<p>Andrews has enthusiastically supported the FSAE racing team since he first met Bob Woods through a mutual friend and has been an avid car aficionado for most of his life. His love for cars and automotive engineering is what initially drew him to UTA&#x2019;s racing team, but it was Woods&#x2019; character and leadership that inspired him to give.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Bob has always encouraged innovation and ingenuity,&#x201D; said Andrews. &#x201C;And his teams have shown great ability to be on the leading edge of technology and use it to their advantage on the track and upon their entry into industry after graduation. UTA&#x2019;s Formula SAE team is the gold standard of collegiate racing, and Bob Woods has been the heart and soul of the program for more than 30 years. I am happy to recognize him by endowing a chair in his honor.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/andrews-woods-endowed-chair-group.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Peter Crouch, College of Engineering Dean; Erian Armanios,&#xA0;Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department Chair; donor Paul E.

The team has since won eight championships in the United States and international titles in England, Japan and Australia.</p>\n<p>At one point, the team earned a No. 1 ranking in the U.S. and climbed as high as No. 5 in the world.</p>\n<p>Each year, participating students from across the campus design and build a formula racing car from the tires up and then race their vehicles against collegiate teams across the country and internationally.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Recent cars have featured active aerodynamics and advanced battery technology, including a hybrid car and a fully electric vehicle that was unveiled in 2017.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are extremely grateful to Paul for his generous gift and for honoring a faculty member who has not only inspired creativity and innovation in hundreds of students but has also mentored them through the Formula SAE competitions to match teamwork and experiential learning with scholarship in the classroom,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;Bob Woods stands as a giant among faculty nationally, setting very high standards of excellence and commitment to student success. He has been instrumental in establishing an internationally renowned program that attracts students from across our campus and this gift ensures not only that his legacy will continue but that the program continues to grow in strength and excellence. Gifts such as these are transformative for a university.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>A 2017 Piper Professor, Distinguished Teaching Professor, and a 2017 UT System Regents Outstanding Teaching Award recipient, Woods has garnered several honors in his time at UTA. He won the &#x201C;Triple E&#x201D; Award from the Society of Automotive Engineers International in 2013. The award is a singular honor given annually for Excellence in Engineering Education. Woods also received the 2006 Chancellor&#x2019;s Teaching Award. The award is presented annually by The University of Texas System Chancellor&#x2019;s Council to recognize excellence in teaching at each of the system&#x2019;s nine universities.</p>\n<p>Woods also worked to establish the Arnold E. Petsche Center for Automotive Engineering. The Center promotes engineering education, innovation and entrepreneurship, especially through FSAE.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Bob Woods and the FSAE program are well-established as leaders in innovation and education here at UTA, and alumni of the program are working for major automotive manufacturers, professional racing teams and dozens of other automotive and mechanical engineering companies nationwide,&#x201D; College of Engineering Dean Peter Crouch said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Having an endowed chair focused on automotive engineering and the FSAE team is a well-deserved recognition of what Bob has built in his time here, and it also puts the College of Engineering on solid footing to protect his legacy long into the future.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department Chair Erian Armanios also underscored what Woods has meant to the program. &#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s FSAE program, driven by Bob Woods, inspired and challenged generations of students. The program harnessed their boundless energy and helped them develop practical skills through the application of complex principles and theories. Paul&#x2019;s investment in education through the Dr. Bob Woods Chair extends his record of caring and creates his legacy of trail-blazing innovation that will light the way to an ever-better future for generations of students to come.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Describing his relationship with Andrews, Woods said, &#x201C;Our friend Arnold Petsche introduced me to Paul Andrews. Paul is a highly successful entrepreneur and businessman and has started, bought and developed very large international electronic corporations.&#xA0;He is also a true &#x2018;car guy&#x2019; and amassed a very large collection of very unique and collectable cars.&#xA0;This interest in cars is what we share and I suspect part of his motivation to support the automotive engineering program at UTA.&#xA0;I am pleased and honored to have my name associated with his.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Woods received a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in mechanical engineering from SMU and master&#x2019;s and doctoral degrees from Oklahoma State University. He had three years&#x2019; experience in research with the government before joining the faculty at UTA. Woods has extensive consulting and industrial experience with national and international companies as well.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>--written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n"
