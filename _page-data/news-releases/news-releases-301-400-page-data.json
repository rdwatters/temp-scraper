Tare&#x2019;s work at UTA&#x2019;s Institute for Sustainability and Global Impact touches each of these themes.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;AASHE also adopted a strategic plan and as a board member, it will be my responsibility to advance this plan by encouraging and directing discussion and collaboration among our member universities,&#x201D; Tare explained.</p>\n<p>Tare is the only representative on the 15-member AASHE board from a Texas university. Other members include sustainability officers from Princeton University, Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Alberta and the University of Illinois at Chicago. Tare was appointed to a three-year term.</p>\n<p>In 2017, under Tare&#x2019;s guidance, UTA received silver status from AASHE&#x2019;s Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System, or STARS, and also was named a &#x201C;Cool School&#x201D; by <i>SIERRA</i> magazine for <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/09/UTA-named-cool-school-for-sustainability.php\">enhancing sustainability efforts</a> across its 420-acre campus.</p>\n<p>Tare also led the university&#x2019;s efforts to successfully launch a <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/09/UTA-named-cool-school-for-sustainability.php\">bike-sharing program</a> in September. Within just four months of its debut, the program serves approximately 700 registered users. Tare plans to add additional bikes in 2018 and is in talks to expand service beyond campus.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I am grateful for the amazing work Meghna has done at UTA and I know she will represent the university in exemplary fashion,&#x201D; said John Hall, vice president for administration and campus operations. &#x201C;I believe the AASHE board will be stronger with her participation. Meghna continually brings regional, national and international awareness to the excellence at UTA, as well as to issues of sustainability on university and college campuses across the country and various other market segments ranging from transportation and airport boards to the National Football League.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Tare was <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/05/Meghna%20Tare%20committee%20appointment.php\">previously named</a> to the Committee on Economic and Social Sustainability for Airports by the Transportation Research Board. She also was recently chosen as a plenary speaker for the global Women Economic Forum in April in New Delhi, where she will be named one of WEF&#x2019;s Women of the Decade in Corporate Social Responsibility.</p>\n"

It will be on display in Ocala, Fla. until late 2019.&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Darryl Lauster, associate professor of sculpture at The University of Texas at Arlington, is one of 10 artists selected from 117 entries from around the world to display his work at the 2018-19 Ocala Outdoor Sculpture Competition in Ocala, Fla.</p>\n<p>Lauster&#x2019;s sculpture is a tribute to the early days of American space exploration and to legendary astronaut and one-time senator John Glenn.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Much of my work relates to American history,&#x201D; Lauster explained. &#x201C;When John Glenn died, I wanted to create something to honor his achievements and the achievements of the initial astronauts who began space travel in the 1960s, the so-called Mercury Seven. This was a seminal moment in time for the United States.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In early 2017, Lauster received a grant from the College of Liberal Arts&#x2019; Wright Faculty Research Endowment. It allowed him to purchase material and begin the complex process of bringing his idea to realization. By the end of the 2017, he had created an impressive 8-foot by 7-foot steel scale replica of Friendship 7, the spacecraft in which Glenn orbited the earth.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I wanted to create it in steel because Glenn flew for the Army, Navy and Marines, so I not only wanted to try to replicate the shuttle, but honor his history of flight with military,&#x201D; Lauster said. &#x201C;While I was working on it, I had the idea to create a solar component, which powers a series of interior sparkling lights. I created a small viewfinder where you can look inside the ship and see the lights which reference stars and celestial lights. Even though the sculpture is on the ground, you can see space.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/lauster-with-sculpture.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Associate Professor of Sculpture Darryl Lauster</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Lauster is one of the approximately 60 artists who make up the distinguished faculty of UTA&#x2019;s Art and Art History Department, which offers the second largest undergraduate art program in Texas. The faculty includes a Guggenheim Fellow, two Joan Mitchell Award recipients and three Moss/Chumley Award recipients. Faculty members have been invited to exhibit in prestigious shows at the Dallas Museum of Art, The Amon Carter Museum, The Central Academy of Art and Design in Beijing, and at venues in Berlin, Rome, Milan, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I am constantly in awe of the tremendously talented people I work with on the UTA campus and particularly in the College of Liberal Arts. Darryl is a wonderful example of this. He is artist who uses his studio not only to inspire a new generation of artists, but also to continually hone his craft,&#x201D; College of Liberal Arts Dean Elisabeth Cawthon said. &#x201C;What a thrill that the College was able to support this project.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Lauster said while the piece was interesting to make, it was extremely complex because he wanted the public to immediately recognize the sculpture as the Friendship 7 spacecraft. He wanted it to look iconic and he quickly realized he achieved that when he was driving the sculpture from one location to another.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I purchased the materials and began to work on it when I was in New York during the summer. When I drove it back to Arlington so that I could continue working on it, I had people waving at me and honking at me and pointing to the back of my truck asking, &#x2018;Hey is that a shuttle?&#x2019; People recognized it even before it was complete,&#x201D; he said.</p>\n<p>He finished the sculpture in his studio on the UTA campus, side by side with his students so they could see how a project of such scale comes together.</p>\n<p>Lauster said it is an honor to be chosen for the Ocala Outdoor Sculpture Competition, one of the most well-known sculpture competitions in the nation. The piece will be on display in Ocala for the next 20 months.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s special for this piece to be in Florida, where the Friendship 7 originally launched,&#x201D; Lauster said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m so appreciative for the generous stipend I received from Dean Cawthon and it&#x2019;s quite gratifying to see this come full circle and represent UTA at a prestigious outdoor exhibition.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Pinpointing what makes the cardiovascular system falter and finding ways to intervene is the goal of UTA researchers in this area, with current projects including developing new nanomaterials, 3-D printing of new blood vessels, battling hypertension among African-Americans and seeking to improve heart health through exercise.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Her goal is to be accepted to UTSW&#x2019;s combined M.D./Ph.D. program and eventually become a pediatric oncologist, with the goal of revolutionizing the field of pediatric cancer treatment.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, she would like to practice medicine and conduct research. She would also like to become a professor at a university, &#x201C;where I may have an impact on my students as my professors at UTA have had on me,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p>Martin&#x2019;s tenacity in the research world isn&#x2019;t unique to UTA students. What makes her story remarkable is that all of her academic accomplishments have come while being a mom. Martin had a son while in high school and while becoming a parent at such a young age obviously presented considerable hurdles for her in terms of her education, she never wavered in her commitment to her goals.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It certainly was not the easiest circumstance; it was difficult trying to balance being a mother full-time with schoolwork and attending school full-time,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;However, I never once doubted myself, and having my son only made me more determined to succeed so that he would have a mother he could be honored to have.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Martin knew early on that chemistry was the subject for her. An enthusiastic advanced placement chemistry teacher at Red Oak High School helped instill a passion for the field in her, and also touted UTA&#x2019;s program.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Martin graduated from Red Oak High School with a 4.0 GPA and she has continued her academic excellence at UTA since enrolling in Fall 2014. She jumped at the opportunity to get involved in research from her very first semester on campus as a member of the Achieving Success in Science through Undergraduate Research and Engagement or ASSURE program. The immersive program allowed her to participate in drug discovery research and helped her gain critical-thinking skills and a knowledge of the world of research.</p>\n<p>Martin was selected for the prestigious UTA Honors College Undergraduate Research Fellowship in 2015, where her research involved determination and isolation of antibacterial compounds from natural products coupled with optimizing methods to better extract and isolate these compounds.</p>\n<p>In 2016 she received a Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation or LSAMP fellowship and conducted research on identifying bacteria from contaminated groundwater. By this time, her affinity for research had led her to amend her original plan of becoming a medical doctor to earning a master&#x2019;s/doctorate and going on to do research in oncology.</p>\n<p>In spring 2016 she was hired as a supplemental instruction leader for an Organic and Quantitative Chemistry class. She helped students to better understand and grasp the course material and through the experience, she found that she loved to teach and help students learn.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;That experience served to solidify and justify my aspiration of pursuing a doctorate in chemistry in addition to medical school,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p>Last summer Martin participated in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program at UTSW&#x2019;s Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, where she studied skin cancer cells to see the effect of knocking down the GLUT1 transporter gene.</p>\n<p>She has received numerous awards and scholarships in her four years at UTA, including first place in the 2015 COS Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium, the Charles R. Knerr Memorial Scholarship, John T. Murchison Endowed Scholarship, Ann H. Benham Endowed Scholarship, Stuckler Family Endowed Scholarship, Chance Vought Engineering and Science Endowment, and the Laurence E. Baker Memorial Scholarship, among others.</p>\n<p>She has been a member of the UTA chapter of the Chemistry and Biochemistry Society, where she served as president, and the Honors College Council, where she was treasurer.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Misty is far and away the most driven, mature and intellectually sound undergraduate student I&#x2019;ve encountered in my 11 years here at UTA,&#x201D; said Kevin Schug, College of Science interim associate dean and Shimadzu Distinguished Professor of Analytical Chemistry. &#x201C;Misty&#x2019;s exceptional intellect and maturity, coupled with her time management skills, make her the total package as a scientific researcher. She is a model of the quality and tenacity that we want to encourage for undergraduate researchers at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Although many admire her because of her academic accomplishments, Martin says she&#x2019;s most proud of the fact that she has succeeded while overcoming challenges in and out of the classroom and laboratory.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I like to think of myself as a positive role model to others, not because of my academic success but because I am a reminder that you can always pick yourself up and do whatever your heart desires, no matter the circumstances,&#x201D; Martin said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- Written by Greg Pederson</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

The award was presented to Hale during the 12<sup>th</sup>&#xA0;Annual UTeach National Conference, held last month in Austin.</p>\n<p>UTeach is a science and mathematics secondary teacher preparation program which began at UT Austin in 1997 to address the need for more highly qualified science and math teachers. It allows students an opportunity to earn a teaching certificate in science or mathematics while also earning a bachelor&#x2019;s degree, all in a four-year time frame. In the two decades since, similar programs have been created at universities nationwide, including at UTA.</p>\n<p>The program utilizes early field experiences in K-12 schools, the use of experienced Master Teachers as instructors, and mentor teachers in local school districts.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I am humbled to have been singled out from among the faculty teaching in UTeach programs across 44 universities in the U.S.,&#x201D; Hale said. &#x201C;We know that Dallas-Fort Worth school districts are in need of well-prepared STEM teachers who will persist in the field, and we know that the UTeach model produces such teachers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Hale was instrumental in raising funds for the creation of the UTeach Arlington program, which started &#xA0;in 2010 and had its first graduating class in 2014. The program has increased secondary mathematics and science teacher production at UTA by 500 percent. He was named one of three UTeach co-directors along with Ramon Lopez, professor of physics, and Ann Cavallo, Distinguished University Professor of Science Education in the College of Education, with Hale serving as the day-to-day managing co-director since the program&#x2019;s inception.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Hale has been an integral part of the UTeach Arlington program from its creation, so it is wonderful to see him being recognized with this award,&#x201D; College of Science Dean Morteza Khaledi said. &#x201C;He has worked tirelessly to secure funding for the program and the work that he, Dr. Lopez, Dr. Cavallo and their colleagues have done has made UTeach Arlington into the tremendous success it is.</p>\n<p>In the UTeach program, Hale has been lead instructor for the Research Methods course nine times and a co-instructor twice, and thus has been able to work with almost every UTeach Arlington graduate. Over his career, Hale has been the sole or lead instructor for nearly 180 lecture course sections, but he says Research Methods is still a whirlwind every semester.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Getting to know almost all of our UTeach Arlington students as instructor of our Research Methods course has been extremely gratifying because I am able to observe the quality of character of the STEM teachers we are sending into the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex,&#x201D; Hale said. &#x201C;Knowing that our graduates will have long and successful careers as teachers, while also being excellent role models for their students, makes all the hard work of building and sustaining our program worth it.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Hale earned a doctorate in Organic Chemistry from the University of Pittsburgh in 1999 and joined the UTA Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry as a lecturer and undergraduate advisor that same year. In his seven years in the department, he taught a total of 63 lecture courses and advised about 200 majors per semester.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Liu and her fellow honorees will be recognized at a reception May 22 at the Westin Galleria in Dallas.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Hanli Liu\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/hanli-liu-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Hanli Liu</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;I am honored and humbled to be recognized at the Women in Technology Awards,&#x201D; Liu said. &#x201C;I am proud to be included alongside these brilliant women leaders as an example of the influence of women in the Dallas-Fort Worth area on their organizations and the greater community.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Liu is a Fellow of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering and a member of the UTA Academy of Distinguished Scholars. She joined UTA&#x2019;s College of Engineering in 1996 and has secured more than $11 million in research funding as principal investigator or co-investigator during her career at UTA. Her research includes medical instrumentation for imaging, minimally invasive or noninvasive spectroscopy of human tissue, optical diffuse imaging of cancer and brain activities.</p>\n<p>Her recent, technology-based research and development is related to non-invasive transcranial infrared brain stimulations or TIBS by shining low-power laser light on the human forehead. In 2016, she led a team that published groundbreaking research in Nature&#x2019;s&#xA0;<i>Scientific Reports</i>&#xA0;that explained the underlying principle of TIBS, followed by another high-impact article in the&#xA0;<i>Journal of</i>&#xA0;<i>Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism.&#xA0;</i>This publication has provided the first demonstration that TIBS can significantly improve metabolic activity, blood flow and blood oxygenation in the human brain.</p>\n<p>The team&#x2019;s novel and rigorous research contributes important insight into the physiological mechanisms, which may provide critical, scientific foundation for an effective, non-pharmaceutical, non-invasive, long-term intervention in the near future for treating brain disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, using light. This direction of technology-oriented research and development matches well the federal BRAIN or Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative and led into a $2.8 million federal funding from the National Institutes of Health to the multi-institutional research team under Liu&#x2019;s leadership.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, she is currently working with a UT Southwestern neonatal intensivist to provide a portable brain imaging system and to develop advanced signal-processing techniques for very ill newborns. Her collaboration will help better measure the babies&#x2019; neurophysiology and brain networks over time, providing physicians with advanced analysis tools needed to guide treatments for encephalopathy or brain swelling more promptly and accurately, which could save the babies&#x2019; lives.</p>\n<p>Liu&#x2019;s previous projects include a nearly $1 million NIH grant to investigate a minimally invasive method of screening and diagnosing prostate cancer using a multichannel optical imaging system. She also won a $1.37 million NIH grant to develop computational optical imaging methods for monitoring anti-stroke therapy. She won 2009 Department of Defense Prostate Research Program grant to develop an optical detection system that allows physicians to find lesions that may have cancer, correctly estimate the cancer&#x2019;s severity and identify tiny, low-grade cancers not likely to cause problems.</p>\n<p>Liu earned her degrees in physics and applied physics, including a doctorate in applied physics, from Wake Forest University. She has published more than 130 journal articles and 140 conference proceedings and holds a few patents, including &#x201C;Optical Methods to Intraoperatively Detect Positive Prostate and Kidney Cancer Margins,&#x201D; which utilizes optical spectroscopy as an innovative technique for&#xA0; demonstration of renal and prostate tumors during surgery.</p>\n<p>Peter Crouch, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Engineering, said that the Women in Technology Award is a great honor for Liu and reflects UTA&#x2019;s commitment to health and the human condition, a theme of the University&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Liu is extremely deserving of this prestigious award. She has distinguished herself as a scholar and a peerless researcher. On behalf of UTA and the College of Engineering, I extend our hearty congratulations,&#x201D; Crouch said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Her contributions in the area of non-invasive neuromodulation using light show great promise for helping scores of people who suffer from neurological or psychological disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and similar afflictions, have a better quality of life.&#x201D;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>\n"

This cancer trap can be used for early diagnosis and treatment of metastasized cancer.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our cancer trap works just like a roach motel, where you put in some bait and the roach goes there and dies,&#x201D; said Liping Tang, UTA bioengineering professor and leader of the research. &#x201C;We are putting biological agents in a cancer trap to attract and kill cancer cells.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This method is effective for both diagnosing and treating metastasis cancer and can be used in combination with traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>Currently, there are many treatments for primary tumors but they do little to prevent metastasis and stray cancer cells from relocating to another part of the body. Surgical removal of cancerous tissue also can spur the spread of cancer in the body. While there are drugs given to patients after surgery to prevent cancer cells from adhering to each other or other tissues, these drugs do not rid the body of cancer cells or collect them to allow an assessment of the patient&#x2019;s status.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We have made a nano-sized device that we can put under the skin using an injection needle to recruit the cancer cells into a small area where we can treat them with less overall side effects to the whole body,&#x201D; Tang said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;So the cancer trap is really complementary to current cancer treatments and especially beneficial at the early stages when it is difficult to see if the cancer is spreading as there are few cancer cells. We have also found it very effective in late stage cancers to stop the spread of the disease and to prolong lifespan,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/tang-osteoarthritis.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Liping Tang, UTA bioengineering professor and inventor of the cancer trap</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The cancer trap works by releasing different chemokines or regulatory proteins to attract circulating cancer cells and then expose them to chemotherapeutic agents to eradicate potential spreading. The trap has been tested in the lab and proved effective on many kinds of cancer cells, including melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia and esophageal cancer. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are hoping to move toward clinical trials in the next few years as this technology could potentially significantly increase the lifespan of cancer patients,&#x201D; Tang said.</p>\n<p>This work on cancer forms part of a larger program at UTA where more than 30 faculty from different colleges and disciplines are developing new solutions to attack this disease.</p>\n<p>With more than $4 million in research expenditures in 2017, UTA&#x2019;s program for cancer encompasses basic cancer research, identification and diagnostics, as well as in noninvasive, midterm, invasive and postoperative therapies. UTA&#x2019;s multidisciplinary research teams harness proficiencies from across science, engineering, computer science, nursing and kinesiology to tackle the challenges of precision oncology and cancer treatment.</p>\n<p>Tang&#x2019;s expertise encompasses a broad area, including stem cells, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, biocompatibility, biomaterials, inflammation, infection and fibrosis. He has published much of his work in high impact journals, including <i>Biomaterials, Journal of Clinical Investigation, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Blood, Journal of Experimental Medicine, and Tissue Engineering.&#xA0;</i></p>\n<p>&#x201C;Tang is a remarkable innovator and internationally recognized researcher,&#x201D; said Michael Cho, UTA&#x2019;s chair of bioengineering. &#x201C;His work is a clear example of UTA&#x2019;s strategic focus on health and the human condition and of the strength of multidisciplinary work.&#x201D;</p>\n"

The Higgs boson is an invisible force-field that permeates space and endows particles with mass. The discovery led to a Nobel Prize for Peter Higgs and Francis Englert, who led the research.</p>\n<p>Last year, UTA had research expenditures of $3.5 million carrying out leading roles in the world&#x2019;s most prestigious new particle physics experiments in the United States and around the world. Total grants over the next decade are expected to surpass $35 million.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;UTA is participating in all the important projects - upgrades to the Large Hadron Collider&#x2019;s ATLAS experiment, the International Linear Collider in Japan, DUNE with the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois and the IceCube experiment in the South Pole,&#x201D; said Kaushik De, UTA physics professor and director of the Center for Excellence in High Energy Physics.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;As a result, we are able to offer our students first-hand experience on international projects at the highest level,&#x201D; he added.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/picture1.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>The DUNE project</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment or DUNE is a U.S.-led international experiment that focuses on&#xA0;neutrinos,&#xA0;subatomic particles that may offer an answer to the lingering mystery of the universe&apos;s matter-antimatter imbalance.</p>\n<p>Physics tells us that matter is created side by side with antimatter. But if matter and antimatter are produced equally, then all of the matter created in the early universe should have been cancelled out by equal amounts of antimatter, eliminating existence itself instantly. And we wouldn&#x2019;t be here.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Neutrinos and their antimatter antineutrinos oscillate as they move through space, changing &#x201C;flavor,&quot; form and mass. Scientists hope that by observing and comparing the oscillations of neutrinos and antineutrinos some difference will become apparent that could explain the matter-antimatter imbalance and hence how our universe came to exist.</p>\n<p>DUNE will consist of two neutrino detectors placed in the world&#x2019;s most intense neutrino beam. One detector will record particle interactions near the source of the beam, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois. A second, much larger, detector will be installed more than a kilometer underground at the Sanford Underground Research Laboratory in Lead, S.D. &#x2014; 1,300 kilometers away from the source, according to the project&#x2019;s website.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our project is to lead work on the DUNE prototype field cage and detectors being developed in collaboration with many European institutions, while the U.S. research facilities are being built,&#x201D; said Jaehoon Yu, UTA physics professor and lead on the DUNE project for UTA.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We already have 10 students working on this and several have travelled to Switzerland to work directly on the project,&#x201D; he added.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The UTA-ETH Zurich, a STEM university, co-designed a field cage, which is a scaled-down prototype of the final cage. The field cage is six meters by six meters by six meters. The electric field already has been tested at 150,000 volts in air and will be operated at 300,000 volts during future testing in liquid argon. The field cage is an important part of the Time Projection Chamber, which&#xA0;captures results when high-energy particles collision with argon atoms.&#xA0;&#xA0;Through these collisions, the particles are captured in the detector and physicists can study the nature of neutrinos and the dark matter coming from beams and from cosmogenic sources.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;What is important is that all these detector elements work together,&#x201D; Yu said. &#x201C;Our teams are given this strategic opportunity because we always deliver on what we promise at the highest quality.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

I thought why not give teaching a try.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The Minnie Stevens Piper Foundation awards the Piper Professors, names Piper Scholars for scholarships and dispenses student loans.</p>\n<p>The award, established in 1958 to recognize outstanding college professors across Texas, is made annually to 15 educators to honor their dedication to teaching and for their outstanding academic achievement. Hullender is the 11<sup>th</sup> UTA professor to be named a Piper Professor.</p>\n<p>Each award includes a certificate of merit, a gold pin and an honorarium of $5,000. An impartial selection committee takes nominees from two- and four-year institutions across the state.</p>\n<p>Erian Armanios, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said Hullender&#x2019;s 2018 Piper Professor naming is an acknowledgment of the transformative power of caring, motivating and inspiring the lives of generations of students for 48 years and counting.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Instilling self-confidence to be a life-long learner starting in the classroom, is Professor Hullender&#x2019;s mantra as teacher and mentor,&#x201D; Armanios said. &#x201C;To quote one of his former students: Dr. Hullender&#x2019;s teaching is a life experience both through in depth view of the course material and real engineering problems.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The accolades from former students are many and include one from Gary Greene, president and CEO of Fort Worth&#x2019;s Cugar Machine Co.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I was equipped with the necessary tools to handle a broad range of skills including mechanical, electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic systems and designs,&#x201D; Greene said in a recommendation letter. &#x201C;You had a positive and logical approach for every problem one might be faced with.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Greene also praised Hullender&#x2019;s positive approach to not only engineering challenges and applying what he learned from the professor.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Utilizing your well-organized straightforward, positive approach, I have used these same basic principles you shared with me to reach out to others with a positive, simplified solution to solve most any problem they&#x2019;re faced with,&#x201D; Greene said in the letter.</p>\n<p>Aaron Davenport, another of Hullender&#x2019;s past students, said his former instructor was always approachable and fair. He said one of Hullender&#x2019;s strengths was teaching problem-solving instead of formula memorization.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Since problem solving was stressed instead of the formula or solution, my understanding and knowledge has stuck,&#x201D; Davenport said in his recommendation letter. &#x201C;I feel confident that what I learned in Dr. Hullender&#x2019;s class, because of the way he presented the material, will be used throughout my career.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Hullender received the 2014 Most Valuable Faculty award sponsored by the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. He also received the 2008 Lockheed Martin Excellence in Teaching Award, the 1983 Outstanding Teacher in the college of Engineering and the 1972 Young Engineer of the Year sponsored by the Fort Worth Chapter of the Texas Society of Professional Engineers.</p>\n<p>Hullender earned his doctorate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He earned his bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees from Oklahoma State University.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

She also took classes at the Art Institute of Dallas.</p>\n<p>The conference attracts higher educational professionals from across the United States to discuss research, policy and practice.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Ambassadors will be speaking to people at the conference, participating in a panel, sharing our experiences and offering ideas on how to make transferring an easier experience,&#x201D; Sanders said. &#x201C;UTA offers a lot of assistance like transfer student orientations and activity fairs &#x2013; I attended those and received a lot of great advice. And UTA&#x2019;s advisers were incredibly helpful navigating things. I want to help shape the process for the future.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Sanders was chosen as a National Transfer Student Ambassador after an intense application process that included a letter of recommendation as well as a written essay and a video describing the transfer journey and her advocacy efforts on behalf of transfers. A talented design student, Sanders previously&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/video/2017/06/cappa-student-designs-for-halle-berry.php\">won a national competition</a>&#xA0;to re-design Hollywood actress Halle Berry&#x2019;s website.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Although all four winners demonstrated excellence in leadership, public speaking and their potential for sharing meaningful information with higher education transfer professionals, it was Veronica&#x2019;s persistence, humility and candid appraisal of the transfer experience that separated her application from the rest,&#x201D; said Janet Marling, executive director for the National Institute for the Study of Transfer Students.</p>\n<p>The other National Transfer Student Ambassadors are from the University of California, Berkeley, Stockton University in New Jersey and The University of Texas at Austin.</p>\n<p>UTA was <a href=\"../../2017/03/transfer-honor-roll.php\">one of only 63 institutions</a> in the nation named to Phi Theta Kappa&#x2019;s Transfer Honor Roll.&#xA0;<i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>&#xA0;<a href=\"../../2017/09/US-news-ranking.php\">ranked UTA No. 1</a> among national public universities for graduating students with the least amount of debt and No. 5 among national universities for undergraduate ethnic diversity.&#xA0;<i>Washington Monthly</i>&#x2019;s 2017 College Guide ranks UTA as the <a href=\"../../2017/11/washington-monthly-adult-learners-ranking.php\">No. 1 four-year university</a> in Texas for adult learners, defined as students over the age of 25.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I advise transfer students to focus on taking core courses at a two-year college because those classes have a greater chance of transferring,&#x201D; Sanders said. &#x201C;I also suggest that those interested in transferring do their research. Don&#x2019;t just rely on your own interpretation of a university&#x2019;s website to determine what will transfer. Call someone. Meet with someone. Speak with people personally to make sure you are getting the right information.&#x201D;</p>\n"

For my parents, it was all about creating a better life for my siblings and me,&#x201D; Newberry said. &#x201C;Knowing where they started, the challenges they faced and how far things have come is inspiring.

Newberry worked at Deloitte for 14 years, leaving her executive role to launch her company in 2008.</p>\n<p>She remembers the difficulties she faced balancing a full-time job while she was a full-time student at UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In addition to getting a solid education, I learned how to juggle a lot between classes, leadership roles and my job,&#x201D; she recalled. &#x201C;I remember being so impressed with the caliber of professors, and that has only improved in the College of Business and across the campus.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>She said this award comes at a particularly special time in her career.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Last year was a record financial year for my company, and in July I will have been in business for 10 years,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s exciting to see that my business continues to grow and clients see value in the work we do. More than 75 percent of our clients get promoted after the work we do together. I can&#x2019;t even begin to tell you how rewarding this is.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My mantra is, &#x2018;You&#x2019;ll see it when you believe it,&#x2019;&#x201D; Newberry said. &#x201C;Most people say the opposite, but you remove half of the struggle when you simply believe that you can make things happen.&#x201D;</p>\n"

Under the direction of James Kumm, a combat veteran and seasoned higher education administrator, the University launched a&#xA0;<a href=\"https://blog.uta.edu/vac/\">veterans assistance website</a>&#xA0;and has plans to open a new Veterans Resource Center, which will be a one-stop-shop for veterans to receive assistance before they enroll, while they are students, and even after they earn a degree through specialized career placement services.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is already successfully integrating our student veterans and military-connected families with amazing programs on campus, but we want to continue to do more,&#x201D; Kumm said. &#x201C;We believe if we can track their progress and intervene when someone needs us, this deserving population will get the most out of their experience at UTA. In turn, the Texas labor force will see an infusion of highly skilled veterans, which are immediate assets to any industry.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Retired U.S. Army Gen.

The research is conducted by speaking with participants in this demographic about their experiences and analyzing how cultural institutions affect their well-being.</p>\n<p>Growing up in Oklahoma, Parekh saw the need to better serve South Asian immigrants, she said. Her grandmother had been a major figure in her life and inspired her to understand the needs of South Asian older adults. Many people in this demographic are dependent on their children to support them in everyday life functions.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;She was really vulnerable because she was dependent on her adult children for all of her needs, and she had been a really independent person back in her country,&#x201D; Parekh said.</p>\n<p>Children and grandchildren can provide a support network for their incoming relatives, she said. A lack of cultural and social ties to the country and isolation from society contributes to this issue. Coming to a new country at their age is a major shift in a later stage in life, which differs from adults who had time to adapt to the United States. Children and grandchildren can provide a support network for their incoming relatives.</p>\n<p>The Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area is affordable and provides opportunities to create businesses. This contributes to the growing population in the area. The South Asian older adult population has increased more than 160 percent from 1990 to 2000, she said.</p>\n<p>However, with this growth comes other challenges, primarily transportation.</p>\n<p>In their native countries, they could typically walk to community centers and gatherings. However, in the United States and in the DFW area this is not the case.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;[I hope to] shed light on this issue so that we can start thinking about how we can provide adequate and reliable transportation to some of the populations that are so hidden,&#x201D; Parekh said.</p>\n<p>Practitioners, researchers and other professionals have trouble accessing this population because many of them do not seek social services, she said. Language barriers also come into play.</p>\n<p>Many of these children have become the caretakers for these seniors. Health issues may go unnoticed because these seniors&#x2019; children are busy with their own lives.</p>\n<p>Parekh is graduating in May and hopes to carry a similar project to the next stage of her career.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As social workers I think we need to continue to incorporate more aging curriculum so that our students are prepared to work with this large growing older adult population,&#x201D; Parekh said.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by John Hoang</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>\n"

        "body": "\n<p>A recently published study by a University of Texas at Arlington urban researcher shows a correlation between urban sprawl and a decreased life expectancy in the United States.</p>\n<p>Shima Hamidi, UTA assistant professor in the College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs, and two directors of the National Institutes of Health have published <i>Associations between Urban Sprawl and Life Expectancy in the United States</i> in the <a href=\"http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/5/861\">International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Shima Hamidi\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/shima-hamidi-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Shima Hamidi,&#xA0;UTA assistant professor in the College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs, has published papers that show the cost of sprawl in a region.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;What the study shows is that the United States is not among the countries with the highest levels of life expectancies despite the highest levels of expenditures on health care,&#x201D; Hamidi said. &#x201C;Changes in urban planning and the way we build things have to be made to help with this challenge.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The published study builds on research that Hamidi wrote and published in July.</p>\n<p><i><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Costs-Sprawl-Reid-Ewing/dp/1138645516\">The Costs of Sprawl</a></i>, written by Hamidi, who also is executive director of The University of Texas at Arlington&#x2019;s Institute of Urban Studies, and Reid Ewing, professor at the University of Utah, originates in studies that were funded from National Institutes of Health and Ford Foundation.</p>\n<p>In the book, Hamidi and Ewing used 21 criteria in evaluating quality-of-life issues among residents who live in major metropolitan statistical areas. This book shows that life expectancy, economic mobility, transportation choices and personal health and safety all improve in less sprawling areas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;What the study shows is that alternatives like the green building movement have to become society&#x2019;s staple and not the exception,&#x201D; Hamidi said. &#x201C;People who live in poorer socioeconomic areas often have to overcome more adversities like greater travel times just to get to work, school or the grocery store.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Hamidi also published two papers recently about how certain aspects of the built environment help attract knowledge-intensive businesses, like Amazon. Hamidi teamed with Ahoura Zandiatashbar, a UTA research associate, to write: <i>Does urban form matter for innovation productivity? A national multi-level study of the association between neighborhood innovation capacity and urban sprawl</i>, which appeared in <a href=\"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0042098018767002\">Urban Studies Journal</a>, and <i>Impacts of transit and walking amenities on robust local knowledge economy</i>, which appeared in Cities Journal published by Elsevier.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The lack of walkable urban developments and supportive transit systems can result in a shift in this recent movement,&#x201D; Zandiatashbar said. &#x201C;Universities, incubators and an inflow of high-tech and innovative firms are critical components to regional innovation ecosystems. They exist in our region, but the developments surrounding them and regional accessibility to them must be more supportive.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The two studies urge the urban concepts of clustering of similar industry, walkability and proximity to urban amenities, diversity and regional connectivity. The studies also denigrate the negative effects of sprawl. But sprawl can be corrected, Hamidi said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We learned that sprawl not only doesn&#x2019;t attract these knowledge intensive businesses, sprawl also chases them away,&#x201D; Hamidi said. &#x201C;One way we can right the ship is through employing more progressive building standards &#x2013; like mixed-use development, walkable and transit supportive &#x2013; when we&#x2019;re adding to our already built environment.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>This new-age, more intensive style of development does more than attract knowledge-intensive businesses, it also attracts the creative class, which fills the jobs these businesses provide.</p>\n<p>Duane Dimos, UTA&apos;s vice president of research, said the work of Hamidi and her colleagues reflects the University&#x2019;s vision of <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/communities.php\">sustainable urban communities</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020 Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We need to start building smarter in our urban settings,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;North Texas is quickly approaching megacity status. With that size must come alternative ways of looking at basics like transportation and construction. Dr. Hamidi is also in tune with what needs to happen by investigating areas that have been successful in attracting high-end companies.&#x201D;</p>\n"

His main advisor will be Scott Edwards, a professor of zoology at Harvard University, curator of ornithology in the university&#x2019;s Museum of Comparative Zoology, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I was obviously very excited when I found out about the award,&#x201D; Card said. &#x201C;Dr. Edwards had already told me he could support me coming to Harvard regardless of the award, but getting this fellowship gives us a lot more flexibility with the project and is a great accomplishment in itself. Given my career goal of being a tenure-track faculty member, having this type of award can be helpful for getting a job and certainly sets me up well to pursue a project that others will likely find interesting.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Card&#x2019;s research will involve studying the evolution of limblessness in an Australian group of skink lizards. Much of the first year of his fellowship will be spent doing field work in Australia, with the following two years to be spent mainly at Harvard.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Limblessness is well-known in snakes, but few realize that several other groups of squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) have also lost limbs independently,&#x201D; Card said. &#x201C;Skink lizards alone have several limb loss events, and I&#x2019;ll be studying a genus in Australia named&#xA0;<i>Lerista</i>&#xA0;where reduced limb morphology has evolved within the past 20 million years. Across this group, different species have different fore- and hind-limb states ranging from a full pentadactyl, or 5-digit, limb to total limblessness, with many combinations in between.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The recent radiation of so many limb morphologies provides a great morphological series in which to explore how digit and limb loss occur, versus a group like snakes where species became limbless over 100 million years ago.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Card explained that he and his colleagues will be generating high-quality genomes for a couple of species and resequencing the genome of dozens of other species to better understand how many times different limb states have evolved.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Existing work indicates that each limb state probably evolved at least a couple times independently within this group, but our genome data will give us far greater power to figure this out,&#x201D; he explained. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll also be taking more refined measurements of limb state using cutting-edge CT scanning techniques to understand skeletal and muscle morphology in limbs &#x2013; it is still an open question whether the same digits are lost in species with the same limb state. These data will also be helpful for truly understanding how morphology varies across this group.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Card&#x2019;s research will also involve some developmental biology work, including the sampling of embryos at different stages of limb development in a limbed and limbless species. CT scanning will be used to understand the morphological details of development, and he and his colleagues will also collect gene expression and epigenetic (i.e., gene expression regulation) data across developmental stages.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In total, our approach can be used to understand the genetics behind normal limb development and how certain genetic changes impact development and lead to different limb and digit morphologies,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;This will obviously be important for this project, but some of our work may have human health ramifications as well.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Card said the training and experience he received during his doctoral studies at UTA have prepared him well for the work he will be doing as part of the NSF fellowship and beyond. He praised his faculty advisor, Todd Castoe, assistant professor of biology, for his guidance and encouragement.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve worked on a lot of projects during my doctoral studies. Todd&#x2019;s lab has been a great environment for learning to become a professional scientist,&#x201D; Card said. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t say enough about how great Todd&#x2019;s mentoring style and effort have been. I&#x2019;ve contributed in small ways to many projects, ranging from genome assemblies of species to venom evolution to repeat element evolution.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In spring 2015 Card received an NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant for his main dissertation project, which focuses on island dwarfism in Central American populations of the&#xA0;<i>Boa imperator</i>&#xA0;snake (a species of the boa constrictor). Card and his colleagues have been able to establish that dwarfism has occurred independently at least twice and are also testing the hypothesis that convergent dwarfism is driven by convergent genetic or molecular mechanisms. The project is ongoing.</p>\n<p>The NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences awards postdoctoral research fellowships in biology to recent doctoral degree recipients to support research and training in selected areas. The fellowships encourage independence at an early stage of the research career to permit fellows to pursue their research and training goals in the most appropriate research locations.</p>\n"

The scientific community has been studying oxygen delivery or oxygen utilization in isolation for some time, but no one has been able to simultaneously study both of these endpoints in the same patient, especially not non-invasively. This will be the first study to assess both sides of the equation at the same time in a clinical setting.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He said the technology will use laser light to track the movement of red blood cells in muscles as well as the oxygen content of the muscle itself. The team plans to develop both the hardware and software in the first year of the grant so that they can begin doing patient studies quickly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Once developed, the technology will be applicable to a wide range of diseases and health conditions. The researchers will focus on patients with heart failure in this project because, despite the name of the diagnosis, these patients also have severe limitations in their peripheral blood vessels and skeletal muscles.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If the muscles are not utilizing oxygen or getting enough oxygen it could contribute to exercise intolerance,&#x201D; Nelson said. &#x201C;By using this technology we will be able to pinpoint specific problems in the periphery and identify new therapeutic targets.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Anne Bavier, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation, said the outcome of this study could be transformative for cardiovascular care.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;For too long people have focused on the heart when it comes to these ailments. But Mike&#x2019;s research so far shows that some of the problems must lie in the muscles. This could strike a big blow for improving health care nationally and globally,&#x201D; said Bavier, who noted that improving health care and the human condition is one of the four themes of UTA&#x2019;s strategic plan. &#x201C;There are plenty of drugs to help treat patients with heart failure, but which one is the best option? I believe this technology has the potential to address this problem by giving clinicians the tools and insight to define therapeutic targets.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In recent years, the college has been steadily transforming into an important destination for health care research, attracting many leading health care scholars. With the influx of these scholars has come a significant increase in research grants. The college now has nearly $8 million in active research grants, up 45 percent from the previous year.</p>\n"

The company is currently working in partnership with UTA and Texas A&amp;M Tyler to further develop light converting greenhouse glazing that helps commercial crop growers increase their productivity by improving the nutritional quality of their crops, extending the lifetime of their greenhouse canopies and significantly increasing crop yield. SolGro&#x2019;s technology does this without the additional energy costs required by indoor grow facilities.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are here because we are TECH Fort Worth clients,&#x201D; Sickels said. &#x201C;TECH Fort Worth has been helping us since &#x201C;square one,&#x201D; with all the business support and corporate strategy. It&#x2019;s been great support. We are also meeting potential investors.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Faculty startup Abexxa Biologics, named one of the 40 Best University Startups in 2017 by the National Council of Entrepreneurial Tech Transfer, is working to identify a new series of biomarkers or targets for cancer from the many thousands of proteins found within a tumor cell. This is a new field of research that could potentially result in immunotherapies that prove effective for a broad range of patients.</p>\n<p>Resonant Sensors is the brainchild of faculty inventor, Robert Magnusson, UTA Texas Instruments Distinguished University Chair in Nanoelectronics and professor of electrical engineering, and UTA graduate Debra Wawro. Magnusson and Wawro have developed a technology based on nanostructured resonant sensors illuminated with light which allows pharmaceutical companies to better define the physical properties of drugs under development.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Suzanne Gimlin, vice president for operations for AbeXXa, was at the event representing both AbeXXa and Resonant Sensors. She underlined that the two startups attended &#x201C;to support TECH Fort Worth as it is such a great program, as well as for networking.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The fourth startup, Nano Liquid Solutions, was developed by Ali Farzbod, a mechanical engineering doctoral student, who is developing a device called Medichip that can help diabetic patients check and receive blood tests quicker. The platform enables a blood test with a small amount of sample, a drop of blood, which results in a massive reduction in materials used and eventually results in a more cost-effective screening.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;For us, this is an important channel as we are looking for a seed investor with connections in the Food and Drug Administration to help us start the development process and build a prototype,&#x201D; Farzbod said.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s Office of Technology Management has developed a weekly entrepreneurship workshop series, called EpICMavs (EpIC = Entrepreneurial, Innovative, Collaborative), where budding and experienced entrepreneurs discuss topics relevant to establishing and building a business. UTA and TECH Fort Worth also developed an &#x201C;EpICMavs Deep Dive&#x201D; cohort where companies work on their business model, company structure, needed funding and company pitches with hands-on mentoring and guidance from experienced entrepreneurs. These efforts are critical to establishing an entrepreneurial ecosystem at UTA. Since its inception in 2015, more than 400 faculty, students and local entrepreneurs have passed through EpIC Mavs.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

It is a program unit of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.</p>\n<p>Moazzeni said that when people are adversely affected by transportation, it hurts personal relationships, the ability to work and a household&#x2019;s economic bottom line.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If a family has to buy a car because mass transit is nowhere to be found, many times keeping, maintaining and operating that car can exceed the cost of public transit,&#x201D; Moazzeni said. &#x201C;Households could spend most of their money on cars, insurance and upkeep.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Moazzeni helped present two sessions. One was titled Planning Process and Environmental Justice. It investigated whether location matters in relationship to federal affordable housing programs and residents&#x2019; transportation affordability in North Texas.</p>\n<p>The second session was titled Pedestrian Planning, Modeling and Simulation. This study examined the impacts of street-level built environment and urban design qualities on walkability in downtown Dallas.</p>\n<p>Both studies presented are only a portion of the vast research being conducted by UTA in the fields of urban planning and transportation equity. CAPPA&#x2019;s Institute of Urban Studies is currently working with several cities across North Texas complex growth issues as the region moves closer to megacity status.</p>\n<p>Moazzeni became interested in transportation equity when she moved to North Texas for her doctorate.</p>\n<p>She said growing up in Isfahan, Iran, mass transit was available, but she found little coordinated mass transit in North Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Isfahan is a very compact city,&#x201D; said Moazzeni of the central Iranian city of 1.7 million. &#x201C;I started thinking how can I make this area a better place. That&#x2019;s how I became interested in transportation and how it affects people.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

These DOE awards support outstanding scientists early in their careers and stimulate research careers in the disciplines supported by the DOE Office of Science.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My research focuses on the search for neutrinoless double beta decay &#x2013; a hypothetical nuclear process, which, if discovered, would prove that neutrino particles are their own anti-particles, and illuminate the origin of their extremely small mass,&#x201D; Jones said. &#x201C;It is a great honor to receive this award to further this research over the next five years.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Physics tells us that matter behaves almost identically to antimatter. But if matter and antimatter were produced equally in the early Universe, then all of the matter should have been annihilated by an equal amount of antimatter, eliminating all mass. And we would not exist.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>However, some matter survived. To explain this asymmetry, some particle physicists claim that the tiny subatomic particle, the neutrino, and its antimatter particle, the antineutrino, may have caused the imbalance. One prediction of their theory is that the neutrino and the antineutrino are in fact the same particle. This process, called leptogenesis, might account for the overall excess of matter in the universe as a whole&#x2014; and why we are here.</p>\n<p>To study this, UTA researchers are looking at a very rare form of radioactive decay called neutrinoless double-beta decay. Radioactive decay is the breakdown of an atomic nucleus releasing energy and matter from the nucleus. Ordinary double-beta decay is an unusual mode of radioactivity in which a nucleus emits two electrons and two antineutrinos at the same time. However, if neutrinos and antineutrinos are in fact identical, then the two antineutrinos can annihilate each other, resulting in what is termed a neutrinoless decay, with all of the energy given to the two electrons.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>To find this neutrinoless double-beta decay, scientists are looking at a very rare event that may occur about once per year in a ton of material, when a xenon atom decays and converts to barium. If a neutrinoless double-beta decay has occurred, you would expect to find a barium ion in coincidence with two electrons of the right total energy. &#xA0;UTA researchers&#x2019; proposed new detector precisely would permit identifying this single barium ion accompanying pairs of electrons created within large quantities of xenon gas.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, UTA researchers demonstrated on a small scale the effectiveness of a biochemistry technique that uses fluorescence or the emission of light to identify barium ions in a large volume of xenon gas. This research was published in&#xA0;<a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.132504\">Physical Review Letters</a>. The researchers now plan to scale up the device for a large-scale detector for neutrinoless double-beta decay, which they envision as a chamber containing a ton of high-pressure, purified xenon gas coupled to a single barium ion sensor.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If we observe even one such event, it would be an important discovery in particle physics, on par with the discovery of the Higgs boson,&#x201D; Jones said. UTA leads the American branch of the Neutrino Experiment with Xenon TPC - Time Projection Chamber or NEXT program, which&#xA0;searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Jones joined UTA as a postdoctorate fellow in 2015 and was hired by UTA as an assistant professor of physics in 2016. He received his undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge University in 2008 and his doctorate in neutrino physics from MIT in 2015. Jones received Martin Deutsch Award for Excellence in Experimental Particle Physics from MIT in 2015 and in 2017 was awarded&#xA0;the Mitsuyoshi Tanaka Dissertation Award in Experimental Particle&#xA0;Physics, which is widely considered the most prestigious dissertation award in the field.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We all congratulate Dr. Jones on receiving this most prestigious research grant. &#xA0; The sustained funding associated with this award will provide a major boost in advancing Dr. Jones research on developing improved methods to search for&#xA0;neutrinoless double-beta decay,&#x201D; said Alex Weiss, UTA chair of physics. &#x201C;His work will also help put UTA in a leading role on important international projects and provides huge opportunities for the students collaborating on his work to learn experimental physics at the highest level.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Even at advanced stages of the disease, one may still retain movement in their eyes. Some technologies have incorporated eye-tracking to enable disabled persons to interact with a computer to communicate messages to a caregiver, but the devices are often difficult to calibrate without expert assistance and do not allow patients to express their wishes right away.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington has been awarded a patent for a revolutionary new technology that is able to scan a user&#x2019;s eye movements and enable them to navigate mobile platforms, such as electric wheelchairs, without the use of hands. The technology would also allow users to communicate to a robotic platform when they would like to use an object, such as a glass of water.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My interest in this technology grew out of seeing how my mother-in-law struggled with eye-tracking devices as an ALS patient,&#x201D; said inventor Christopher McMurrough, now a computer science and engineering lecturer at UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The latest version of our device can be worn as a pair of ski goggles with cameras on top and eye-trackers embedded in the lenses, making it very easy for patients to use it over long periods of time as it moves with them,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaptionNaN\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/chrisexperimentjpeg.png\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>This new technology, called a 3-D point of gaze headset, grew out of McMurrough&#x2019;s doctoral thesis in computer science and engineering as a student at UTA. The device combines 3-D mapping using a 3-D camera on the top of the glasses, with eye tracking. The data is then fed into a program that models the user&#x2019;s surrounding environment and what is currently being looked at by projecting the line of vision out and crossing it with the 3-D view from the camera.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This technology could also be important to track medical problems that affect eye movement patterns, such as stroke, low blood pressure and other conditions,&#x201D; McMurrough said. &#x201C;We are also seeing that it could have implications for video games and emerging augmented reality applications.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Traditionally, such an achievement has been reserved for classes with abundant resources and contacts like Spike Lee&#x2019;s New York University&#x2019;s film class.</p>\n<p>The class project was unproduced work Niven solicited from Kevin Sutton at Moroch Agency in Dallas.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I fell in love with the story boards and we went to work,&#x201D; Niven said.</p>\n<p>Niven created a work environment that simulated a real-world production company to enhance the student experience. The class participated in a conference call with the agency, brainstormed concepts and wrote mock director&#x2019;s treatments, which he evaluated to award the job of directing the commercial. Though only three students won the opportunity to direct one of the three commercial spots, every student participated in the tasks of lighting, sound, directing, scouting and green screen work. The student directors were Jessica Flores, Hien Dinh and Aaron Payton.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I felt comfortable to share all of my ideas with Norry,&#x201D; Flores said. &#x201C;He validated my ambition as a director. I wanted to reach for the stars.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>After the class went through a vigorous casting process, working with Lynne Quirion Casting in Los Angeles, two local comedians were selected for the leading roles. Oliver Tull and Troy Grant from the comedy troupe &#x201C;Four Day Weekend,&#x201D; received the class creative products and were energetic about being a part of the project.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The finished spots were aired on the Sierra Club website and were used by Earth Day Texas. The accolades and awards for the commercials exceeded even Niven&#x2019;s expectations.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The public response to the spots has been phenomenal and having the work recognized with awards is surely thrilling for the students,&#x201D; Niven said. &#x201C;But the biggest honor for me to date is when the AICP revealed its 2018 short list, and we were on it.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Members of the AICP account for the production of nearly 85 percent of all nationally televised commercials. Niven stressed that AICP is an extremely difficult show to get into and one of great honor and prestige.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In the past decade only one commercial from a Texas production company has been in that show - it was one I directed for a Showtime series called <i>Dexter</i>. &#xA0;So having three spots in that show, with all UTA students is simply incredible.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The AICP screened the UTA submissions, along with the other contenders in nearly two dozen categories, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York this month.&#xA0; Though a win in this venue would be a complete upset, Niven said the nomination is one of the best things to have happened to him as a professor.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m proud of every single student I had in that class. They can all say for the rest of their lives, &#x2018;While at UTA, I worked on an award-winning commercial campaign,&#x2019; and they will have the spots in their portfolios to prove it,&#x201D; Niven said.</p>\n<p>Niven&#x2019;s portfolio includes feature films, music videos and commercial work for global brands like Gatorade, Ford, McDonalds and Visa continued, &#x201C;They all might not realize the importance of this experience right now, but I feel like we literally caught lightning in a bottle.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Niven currently has nine different national spots on air &#x2013; including Showtime and Fox, two television series that are close to production &#x2013; and is opening a new studio and production facility in Texas.</p>\n<p>In addition, he plans to continue teaching at UTA in the fall.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Robert Hower, chair of UTA&#x2019;s Art and Art History Department, said, &#x201C;How fortunate our advanced film students are to have an opportunity to work with a top tier professional. We look forward to Norry Niven providing our students with exceptional experiences in the future. It is a significant step for our program to have students screening their work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Flores said, &#x201C;I am so excited to see the kind of response our spots are getting.

An endowment from Ahmed, a 1981 graduate of UTA, created the College of Liberal Arts&#x2019; Festival of Ideas Global Institute. Ahmed&#x2019;s goal was to create an outlet for students and the community to explore cultural and academic ideas together. This year&#x2019;s festival explored the global link to entrepreneurship and offered current and future entrepreneurs a venue to share their successes and struggles.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA is an exceedingly healthy starting ground for entrepreneurs and innovators. In the last five years, UTA faculty have received more than 100 patents. About 60 faculty and students are working on start-up businesses, with more than 20 companies currently developing around UTA.</p>\n<p>More than one speaker reminded the crowd that believing in what one does and being motivated by one&#x2019;s cause is an important factor in success.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The&#xA0;phrase find your passion may seem overused but it should not be underestimated in entrepreneurship,&#x201D; Cawthon said. &#x201C;It is even better if your passion becomes the solution to someone else&#x2019;s problem. We aren&#x2019;t all going to save the world, but some of these future entrepreneurs just may.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/libarts/events/2018%20Festival%20of%20Ideas.php\">Click here</a> for more information and a photo gallery from the event.</p>\n"

Our thoughts are with his family. Please visit the <a href=\"https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/williamsburg-va/robert-schafrik-7930987\">Dignity Memorial site</a>&#xA0;for more information.<br></em></p>\n<p>National Academy of Engineering member Robert Schafrik, an internationally renowned expert in materials and manufacturing, has joined The University of Texas at Arlington, strengthening the university&#x2019;s programs around manufacturing, materials, and aerospace engineering.</p>\n<p>Schafrik&#x2019;s recruitment received support from Gov. Greg Abbott&#x2019;s Governor&#x2019;s University Research Initiative and the University of Texas System Science and Technology Acquisition and Retention, or STARS program. The GURI program is a matching grant program that assists higher education institutions in &#xA0;recruiting distinguished researchers to the State of Texas. UTA was awarded a matching GURI grant totaling $2 million for a total startup fund of $4 million.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Texas is pleased to support UTA&#x2019;s success in hiring Dr. Schafrik, which reflects the growing reputation of the University as a Carnegie R1: Highest Research Activity institution,&#x201D; said Gov. Greg Abbott. &#x201C;Our GURI initiative is a strategic investment to vault the standings of our public colleges and universities into the top-ranked nationally.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We at UTA would like to thank the governor for his support,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;Dr. Schafrik&#x2019;s unique experience will enhance our world-class team in composite materials, advanced manufacturing and computational materials science, and give an important boost to UTA&#x2019;s innovation, commercialization activities and startup initiatives through his extensive experience bringing inventions to the market.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Schafrik, the new Presidential Distinguished Professor of Industrial, Systems and Manufacturing Engineering, will have a secondary appointment in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The current visionary leadership&#xA0;and&#xA0;upward trajectory&#xA0;at UTA &#xA0;attracted me to the University and it&#x2019;s great that I can be a part of this dynamic research,&#x201D; Schafrik said. &#x201C;I used to come here to the General Dynamics facility - now Lockheed Martin - when I was in the Air Force and it is amazing to see the dramatic changes at UTA since then, especially the growth into an outstanding Carnegie R-1 institution.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Alongside his academic responsibilities, Schafrik will collaborate extensively with the Institute for Predictive Performance Methodologies at the UTA Research Institute, which has brought together a group of world-renowned experts led by NAE member Kenneth Reifsnider in the area of modeling, analysis, and prediction of composite and advanced material performance in structures and systems. The IPPM laboratory is working with companies like Triumph Aerostructures, Lockheed Martin, GE, Bell Helicopter and Boeing to extend lifetime and predict failure in aerospace structures and turbine engines before they occur. IPPM is also working with NASA to predict the strength and life of rotor blade assemblies, or rotor spars.</p>\n<p>This new strategic hire comes as UTA continues to grow its scholarly and research enterprise, on track to graduate more than 200 doctoral degrees for the fifth year in a row and with research expenditures expected to top $104 million in 2018.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;2018 will be another landmark year for UTA,&#x201D; said Duane Dimos, UTA vice president for research. &#x201D;The opening in September of our new 230,000-square-foot Science and Engineering Innovation and Research building, a state-of-the-art teaching and research space, will enable even more innovative interdisciplinary collaboration across the campus.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA College of Engineering Dean Peter Crouch added that &#x201C;Having Dr. Schafrik join the College also gives us immediate access to industrial contacts in the Dallas-Fort Worth area as well as nationally, and a much-enhanced knowledge base from which to launch new research initiatives.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;He will also be able to advise and mentor graduate and undergraduate students in careers in aerospace and manufacturing, which are growth sectors in the DFW area,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>Schafrik holds 21 U.S. patents and was inducted into the GE Aviation Propulsion Hall of Fame in 2016. He also received the ASM International Eisenman Award for lifetime achievement in materials and, as a National Academy of Engineering member, is pre-eminent in his field.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>He is a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who held senior positions at the National Research Council&#x2019;s National Materials Advisory Board and Board on Manufacturing and Engineering Design before joining GE Aviation in 1997, where he rose to general manager of the Materials and Process Engineering Department.</p>\n<p>Schafrik also currently holds several positions in leading professional associations, including as a member of the audit committee of the National Academy of Engineering, and as chair of the National Research Council&#x2019;s Committee on Connector Reliability for Offshore Oil and Natural Gas Operations.</p>\n<p>He earned his bachelor&#x2019;s degree of science in metallurgy from Case-Western Reserve University, master&apos;s of science degree in aerospace engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology and master&apos;s of science degree in information systems from George Mason University. He earned a doctorate in metallurgical engineering from Ohio State University.</p>\n"

I congratulate Dr. Dasgupta on yet another honor in his remarkable career.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dasgupta, a native of India, was <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/08/Dasgupta%20Talanta%20Award.php\">previously named</a> the recipient of the 2017 Talanta Medal, an international award in the field of analytical chemistry. The Talanta Medal will be presented in March. In January, one of his papers was listed in <i>The Analytical Scientist</i> as among ten <a href=\"https://theanalyticalscientist.com/issues/0118/landmark-literature-part-i/\">landmark literature</a> papers in the discipline for 2017.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is a big thrill that this is happening and an honor to be among the other teachers and scholars who have received these awards,&#x201D; Dasgupta said.&#xA0; &#x201C;They have all left behind a cadre of very successful students, and that is what is most exciting to me.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The Distinguished Texas Scientist Award is particularly special because I&#x2019;ve spent all of my professional career in Texas,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m also touched that this is an award for a scientist, not a chemist, because while we often like to compartmentalize things, I&#x2019;m proud that the impact of my work is seen as going beyond the disciplines.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dasgupta, considered a pioneer in the field of ion chromatography, is perhaps most recognized for his work in iodine nutrition. He testified before Congress on the significance of perchlorate in women&#x2019;s breast milk. Perchlorate interferes with iodine uptake and iodine is the single most important element in thyroid hormones, which govern neurodevelopment.</p>\n<p>Among his lab&#x2019;s active research projects are an environmentally friendly analysis of arsenic in drinking water, the development of a NASA-funded ion chromatograph for testing extraterrestrial soil and the measurement of cyanide in saliva, blood and breath to more rapidly treat cyanide poisoning. Dasgupta says his lab &#x201C;fosters builders, not users.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The first recipient of the Texas Academy of Science&#x2019;s Distinguished Texas Scientist Award in 1979 was Dr. Michael DeBakey, a legendary heart doctor who is widely considered one of the greatest heart surgeons in history. Another recipient was Ilya Prigogine, who also received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>\n<p>Dasgupta is only the second UTA researcher to receive the Texas Academy of Science&#x2019;s Distinguished Texas Scientist Award. Jonathan Campbell, professor of herpetology and chair of the Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center at UTA, was named the 2003 Distinguished Texas Scientist. Since its inception in 1979, the award has been given to three times as many biologists as chemists.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Dasgupta is most deserving of this award, and the recognition is long overdue,&#x201D; Campbell said. &#x201C;This is an extremely rewarding honor because it not only recognizes his achievements, but it also means his peers in Texas have taken notice of the impact of his work.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dasgupta&#x2019;s father and grandfather were also educators. His family instilled in him a passion for discovery and education, which explains his love of teaching.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Awards are really just a reflection of what my students have done,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;To see enlightenment in their eyes &#x2013; nothing can replace that pleasure. Each and every one of them contributes something unique to my ideas. So, I can&#x2019;t take credit for these awards. In fact, I&#x2019;m thankful to all of my students because this recognizes what they have done.&#x201D;</p>\n"

        "body": "\n<p>Curtis Andresson started at The Univeristy of Texas at Arlington last week as the vice provost for international affairs. We asked him about his journeys around the world and what brought him to UTA.</p>\n<p>After spending much of his professional life in the Far East and Australia, Andressen looked at the geographical map of his life and decided that, for him, the Middle East was a big, white area marked as unknown. Instead of accepting the job cards Andressen had been dealt, he decided his career path needed to shift to include the Middle East and accepted the Marubeni Chair in Social Sciences at Qatar University.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Curtis Andressen\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/curtis-andressen-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Curtis Andressen started recently as UTA&apos;s vice provost for international affairs.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;It was a culture shock and change for me,&#x201D; Andressen said. &#x201C;What I realized in this land where the culture is very different &#x2013; men and women were in separate classes, women were clothed head to toe and men were very, very polite &#x2013; is that people are people. Those students wanted the same things that students all over the world wanted &#x2013; skills they can use in the marketplace and bright futures for themselves and their families.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Andressen advocates the belief that higher education is a commodity like energy or electronics.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I think the world &#x2013; especially Asia and Australia &#x2013; have come to this realization,&#x201D; Andressen said. &#x201C;We have no problem marketing tourism or manufacturing as commodities, as things that can be sold. Why shouldn&#x2019;t we treat higher education in the same way? More and more people are seeing higher education as a part of the marketplace.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>India and China are the largest contributors to UTA&#x2019;s international enrollment. He said students from India have been attracted to engineering but also become entrepreneurial while earning their degrees.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is doing well now but we can do even better,&#x201D; Andressen said. &#x201C;China has undergone so many changes in the last couple of decades. It used to be much poorer, more agrarian. There were very few cars 30 years ago. Now, everyone seems to have a car. There&#x2019;s been an emergence of a middle class and with that rise in wealth comes a need and desire for higher education. They&#x2019;re very hungry for higher education.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Andressen said another goal will be to increase UTA&#x2019;s global visibility. He will connect with universities overseas, pair UTA researchers with colleagues across the globe and suggest creating and attending joint conferences.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These efforts build trust and networking among the professors and their colleagues,&#x201D; Andressen said.</p>\n<p>UTA currently ranks No. 20 in the nation in overseas enrollment, which is impressive.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s great,&#x201D; Andressen said. &#x201C;But there isn&#x2019;t anything saying that we can&#x2019;t do better. UTA can have an even better global reputation. We should be aiming for the stars.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>He offered an example from the University of Melbourne.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Australia is good at this,&#x201D; Andressen said. &#x201C;That country has recognized that higher education is a commodity that people all over the globe want.&#x201D; He said about 38 percent of the student population at the University of Melbourne comes from foreign shores.</p>\n<p>He said international students also bring an economic weight while they&#x2019;re here in this country earning their degrees.</p>\n<p>The National Association of International Educators&#x2019; latest analysis shows that the 1 million international students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed nearly $37 billion and supported more than 450,000 jobs in the U.S. economy during the 2016-17 academic year.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;By and large, these international students get their degrees and return to their home countries,&#x201D; Andressen said. &#x201C;But while they&#x2019;re here, they buy groceries, attend events, live here. All that money is money that stays here and impacts wherever the students reside.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Andressen was previously a faculty member in international relations at Flinders University in Australia and visiting researcher at National Cheng Chi University in Taiwan, Valencia University in Spain, and Chuo and Ochanomizu universities in Tokyo.</p>\n"

Traditional antiwear additives are prone to ash generation which has adverse effects on engine life. Researchers have developed new ashless anti-wear and friction-reducing formulations that provide superior wear performance in comparison to the traditional antiwear additives like ZDDP.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Device for assessing soil heave</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"DefaultCxSpMiddle\">Expansive soils undergo swell and shrinkage and can cause severe damage to civil engineering structures. Chemical stabilization is used on these soils, but but the presence of sulphate compounds can lead to heaving or upward movement of soils. Researchers have built an integrated hybrid sensor capable of assessing sulphate heave in treated soils, with the added feature of being suitable for both laboratory and field testing.</p>\n<p class=\"DefaultCxSpMiddle\">&#x201C;UTA has a strong innovation ecosystem that enables the university to patent the inventions created by its faculty and students and to find the funding or licensing opportunities that enables companies to bring those inventions to the market,&#x201D; said Teri Schultz, director of UTA&#x2019;s Office of Technology Management. &#x201C;We are proud members of the UT System and aim to continue to contribute strongly to the UT System&#x2019;s high ranking in the <i>Top 100 Worldwide Universities Granted U.S. Utility Patents.&#x201D;</i></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Interpretation of these data is always difficult however, because these patients also tend to have other cardiovascular abnormalities, such as insulin resistance and hypertension. Our study attempts to address this previous limitation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nelson and his team will study the effects of excess fat in isolation of cardiovascular or metabolic risk factors. Their preliminary data shows that men may respond differently than pre-menopausal women, who appear to be protected despite similar levels of fat in the heart. Nelson and his team of researchers will spend the next five years studying 60 healthy subjects &#x2013; 15 men and 45 women - between the ages of 18 and 30 to better understand the links between different factors.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The incidence of heart disease in premenopausal women is much less than their age-matched male counterparts,&#x201D; Nelson said. &#x201C;After menopause, however, women quickly catch up to men, and in some cases, surpass them.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This major new grant in UTA&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation is one of many new awards in the area of heart health over the last year, and reflects on the success of the College&#x2019;s strategic hires in kinesiology, a department whose research expenditures have grown significantly during the last four years. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s kinesiology department specializes in examining health and disease across the lifespan, with specialized research clusters looking at cardiovascular health, bone and muscle health, fighting cancer, and motor control development in children,&#x201D; UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said. &#x201C;This new NIH grant builds on ongoing research within the department and across UTA under our strategic plan theme of health and the human condition and highlights the research leadership and expertise of our renowned faculty.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m pleased to see them serve as lead principal investigators on collaborative projects with researchers representing leading universities and major medical research centers from around the country.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nelson, principal investigator on this project, will work with a team of researchers that includes Mark Haykowsky, professor of nursing at UTA and the Moritz Chair of Geriatrics, and Daisha Cipher, associate professor of nursing. Other co-investigators include researchers from UT Southwestern, Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and the University of Colorado in Denver.</p>\n<p>Collaborative projects are a hallmark of health science research at UTA, with highly regarded faculty members from the College of Nursing and Health Innovation routinely partnering with talented colleagues from UTA&#x2019;s other schools and colleges, as well as outside institutions, to facilitate fundamental and high-impact clinical translational research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Health science research requires an interdisciplinary focus to take innovation to the next level, and we at the College of Nursing and Health Innovation are proud to be at the forefront as the University continues to excel in cutting-edge research,&#x201D; said Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation.</p>\n<p>Opportunities for interdisciplinary research will be further enhanced when the state-of-the-art Science &amp; Engineering Innovation &amp; Research, or SEIR, Building opens in July 2018. In addition to supporting impressive campus-wide enrollment growth, the 220,000-square-foot building will feature research neighborhoods in which scientists from various health science disciplines will work together in 12 collaborative laboratory spaces focusing on thematic areas like cardiovascular health, brain health, cancer and tissue engineering. SEIR also will provide new opportunities for the university&#x2019;s focus on the study of human genomics as it relates to improving health and finding solutions for disease.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, the NIH also awarded Nelson a $441,000 grant to build new imaging technology to study blood vessel function in patients with heart failure. This technology could lead to quicker diagnosis and life-saving treatment. Nelson is collaborating with colleagues from UTA&#x2019;s Department of Biomedical Engineering on this grant. Since joining UTA two years ago, Nelson has helped bring in more than $4 million in grants.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Over the last four years, UTA has received $11.5 million from the NIH, which speaks to the university&#x2019;s growing reputation as a major health science research institution,&#x201D; said Duane Dimos, UTA vice president for research.</p>\n<p>Research funding in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation rose by 45 percent from 2016 to 2017, due in part to the recent addition of 10 leading health care scholars to the college&#x2019;s faculty.&#xA0;</p>\n"

She is also a member of the Engineering Student Council and was named the College of Engineering&#x2019;s Ms. Engineer in 2017.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Frias is the recipient of a Dwight D. Eisenhower Fellowship and a National Institute for Transportation and Communities Scholarship and is an intern at Di Sciullo-Terry, Stanton &amp; Associates Inc., in Arlington.</p>\n<p>The national ASCE program recognizes civil engineering students for their academic accomplishments and commitment to serving others. One honoree will receive a $1,000 scholarship.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Each of the New Faces of Civil Engineering, Collegiate Edition, displays a passion and dedication for the civil engineering profession through their studies and extracurricular activities. They are the role models that the next generation of civil engineers will look up to,&#x201D; said Kristina Swallow, P.E., president of ASCE.</p>\n<p>Frias said, &#x201C;I was blindsided. I&#x2019;m honored and humbled to have won. I never considered that I would be in this position.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Frias&#x2019; interest in engineering was ignited in seventh grade after she attended a STEM-focused summer camp. Her interest in civil engineering was confirmed in eighth grade, when her family moved to a new house and she spoke to a woman engineer involved in the design and construction of other homes in the neighborhood.</p>\n<p>Prior to enrolling at UTA, Frias participated in an externship with a local civil engineering company, where she learned about land development.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I feel like UTA has prepared me well for my future in this field. The classes and electives reflect what employers in the field are looking for, and I really like the professors here. They do a great job and put a lot of effort into making sure we learn what we need to be successful. That really makes a difference,&#x201D; Frias said.</p>\n<p>Her faculty mentor, civil engineering Professor Jim Williams, encouraged her to become more involved in professional organizations, and his enthusiasm for transportation, as well as courses in urban planning with Kate Hyun, introduction to transportation with Steve Mattingly, and her current highway design course with Sia Ardekani, cemented her decision to pursue transportation engineering. She plans to begin studies toward a master&#x2019;s degree in the discipline at UTA next fall.</p>\n<p>Williams expressed admiration for Frias and her work ethic.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Maria is very deserving of this honor. She is an excellent leader and inspires her peers to do things and participate. She&#x2019;s someone I&#x2019;d love to work with or work for,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know her very well when she was elected president of our ASCE chapter, but she stood out right away. We&#x2019;ve been among the top third of chapters nationally for the last three years, and a lot of that is due to her efforts.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Ali Abolmaali, Tseng Huang Endowed Professor and chair of the Civil Engineering Department, said that Frias is an example of the University&#x2019;s commitment to transforming the student experience by enhancing access and ensuring success.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Being named one of the 10 New Faces of Engineering is quite an honor for Maria, and I am proud that she represents UTA. That Maria won this award is indicative of just how strong our undergraduate program is. Our students have engaged with professional societies nationally and have set themselves apart with successes outside the University in the steel bridge and concrete canoe competitions, among others,&#x201D; Abolmaali said.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s Civil Engineering Department was ranked No. 82 in the most recent U.S. News &amp; World Report graduate engineering rankings. It is the largest and most comprehensive in North Texas, offering bachelor&#x2019;s degrees in architectural engineering, civil engineering and construction management, master&#x2019;s degrees in civil engineering and construction management, and doctoral degrees in civil engineering. Research areas include geotechnical, water resources, transportation, structural and environmental engineering, as well as construction engineering and management, and infrastructure system engineering and management. More than 1,100 students were enrolled in fall 2017.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As a UTA civil engineering alumnus, I was happy to see a UTA student among ASCE&#x2019;s Top 10 New Faces of Engineering, and I offer Maria my hearty congratulations,&#x201D; said Bill Hale, P.E., chief engineer at the Texas Department of Transportation, who earned bachelor&#x2019;s and master&#x2019;s degrees from UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The education and training I received at UTA has served me well throughout my career, and the Civil Engineering Department continues to be a source of quality engineers and researchers who are making an impact on the transportation needs of this state.&quot;</p>\n<p>Faculty members are involved in many transportation-related projects in Texas and nationally. Recent grants include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UTA researchers are part of three U.S. Department of Transportation grants that could be worth up to $12 million in funding. UTA was awarded funding which could total up to $7.7 million over a five-year period to develop the Center for Transportation Equity, Decisions and Dollars. C-TEDD is a collaboration between the Civil Engineering Department and UTA&#x2019;s College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs, as well as partners California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of South Florida.

As the CEO and treasurer, respectively, of Bioworld Merchandising Inc., both helped transform a business idea Raj had during his days at The University of Texas at Arlington into a global company recognized as a leader in the apparel licensing and branding industry.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption450\"><img alt=\"Vistasp Karbhari, Mona Malik, Raj Malik and Troy Johnson\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/malik-gift-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari, Mona Malik, Raj Malik and Troy Johnson,&#xA0;UTA&apos;s vice president of enrollment management, celebrate the $500,000 gift the Maliks gave UTA for a student scholarship endowment.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;I was raised by parents who instilled in me from an early age that it was virtuous to help everyone around you,&#x201D; Raj said. &#x201C;I want to make sure these scholarships enable students to pursue their dreams.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The University announced today that Raj and Mona have pledged $500,000 to establish a permanent scholarship endowment to fund need-based scholarships for students, including international students. The Maliks are now counted among the numerous donors who have made the dream of a college education possible for current and future students at UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is extremely fortunate to have the support of tremendous alumni and friends such as the Maliks. Raj&#x2019;s story from student to leader of industry is inspiring, and his spirit of entrepreneurship has already been the catalyst for so many of our students. The gift announced today will be transformational &#x2013; enabling current students to achieve their dreams and in doing so change not just their own lives but those of their families and the communities in which they reside,&#x201D; said President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m deeply grateful to the Maliks for paying it forward through this endowment and would like to thank them for providing hope and enabling the promise of a future for students at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Raj graduated from UTA in 1993 with a degree in computer science engineering. While he initially created the business plan for Bioworld in the early 1990s while a college student, it took persistence and commitment to launch the company in 2000. Irving-based Bioworld Merchandising Inc. is now averaging compound annual growth of over 20 percent and employs a workforce of more than 200. The company has licensing agreements with the major studios and intellectual property holders in the country, representing apparel, movie and entertainment brands. It recently acquired Global Design Concepts, expanding the company&#x2019;s reach into children&#x2019;s apparel and accessories across Europe and Asia.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I came from India directly to UTA when I was 19 years old and want to extend my sincere thanks to the entire UTA community &#x2013; the staff, students and faculty who supported me and helped make the transition seamless,&#x201D; Raj said. &#x201C;Although I was a computer science major, I drifted away from that area of study more than a few times, and the tremendous faculty supported me in all of my endeavors. They remain a group of educators dedicated to inclusiveness and accessibility for all. I can confidently state that I would not be here without their support.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Paying back their success is what makes their commitment to UTA all the more inspiring, and it is a major reason why the University is thriving as the third-largest producer of intellectual capital in Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I am thankful for the work Dr. Karbhari and his team are doing,&#x201D; Raj said. &#x201C;They are an outstanding representative of an American public institution of higher education. I am very proud to be a UTA alumnus and want to thank them for everything they have done for our family.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Rose Youngblood, interim vice president for development and alumni relations, said, &#x201C;Alumni support through private philanthropy is sending a very strong signal to our students. When students see they are going to graduate into a proud and faithful alumni family that gives back their time and their financial support, they become even more determined to achieve their goals. Raj and Mona&#x2019;s gift is a great example of the difference our alumni are making on campus today.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Last year, UTA awarded a record 12,746 degrees, the third most in the state and a 10.6 percent increase over 2015-2016. Enrollment reached almost 43,000 Texas-based students in the spring 2018 semester, a record high and a 2.4 percent increase over last spring, with a global total of more than 60,000 expected this academic year.</p>\n<p>Scholarships have become a vital piece of UTA&#x2019;s progress as a top-tier school of choice for students around the globe. The Rajeev and Ritu Malik Endowed Scholarship for Student Success will undoubtedly continue the University&#x2019;s forward momentum by attracting local and international students.</p>\n<p>With such rapid growth, opportunities abound to foster an environment of success for talented students at UTA, and the commitment of the Maliks demonstrates that giving back not only helps these students thrive but also has the potential to enrich our entire community by sparking new ideas that drive our economy and improve our quality of life.&apos;</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- Written by Tommy White</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">&#xA0;&#xA0;</div>\n"

Bobadilla serves as assistant provost for Hispanic student success and senior associate vice president for outreach services and community engagement at The University of Texas at Arlington.</p>\n<p>The initiative&#x2019;s goal is to build a robust college-to-career pipeline between Hispanic-Serving Institutions, like UTA, and the corporations who partner with the Foundation, resulting in enhanced career readiness for students and an immediately employable talent pool for various industries.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The initial focus of University Partnerships will be to identify strong regional matches between universities, community colleges, and businesses working with Hispanic chambers of commerce across the state, and begin to network the entities and leverage shared resources,&#x201D; Bobadilla said. &#x201C;There are multiple reasons why UTA is the right institution to spearhead this effort.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington serves more Hispanic students than any other four-year public university in North Texas. UTA is one of only 10 universities in the nation to achieve the designation of both Hispanic-Serving Institution and R-1: Highest Research Activity in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.</p>\n<p>Bobadilla said she will immediately begin working with industry leaders to cultivate paid internship and real experiential learning opportunities. &#x201C;Internships are critical for career success and must be paid in order for students, many of whom are first generation and working their way through college, to be able to afford the opportunity,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p>Troy Johnson, UTA&#x2019;s vice president of enrollment management said, &#x201C;For UTA to be asked to spearhead this effort by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Foundation is proof of the pivotal role we&#x2019;re playing to ensure that America&#x2019;s students are career and workforce ready. The University Partnerships initiative will allow universities to nimbly answer the workforce needs of students and employers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Johnson will act as an adviser on the initiative, as will Linda Battles, Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board deputy commissioner and chief operating officer. THECB board member Arcilia Acosta will co-chair the initiative with Bobadilla.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The University Partnerships initiative aligns perfectly with 60x30TX,&#x201D; said Acosta. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve set a goal for at least 60 percent of Texans ages 25&#x2013;34 to have a certificate or a degree by 2030. We must accomplish this in order to fill the labor demands of industries in our state. We will not be able to arrive at that attainment goal if we don&#x2019;t focus on our Hispanic students and ensure they have multiple pathways for obtaining postsecondary degrees and credentials.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Only 25 percent of Latinos in Texas ages 25-34 currently have a postsecondary degree or certificate.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our 60x30TX plan is ambitious, but attainable, especially if higher education and the business community work more closely together than ever before,&#x201D; Battles said. &#x201C;The University Partnerships initiative directly addresses two goals of the plan &#x2014; marketable skills and student debt &#x2014; which are clearly in line with our larger goal of a more educated workforce. This will result in a distinct competitive advantage for Texas.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Nina Vaca, chair of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce Foundation, added, &#x201C;I am so proud that the USHCC Foundation has embarked on this legacy initiative with two such distinguished partners. With Texas as our launching point, our goal is to expand the University Partnerships initiative nationwide and to include as many university and corporate partnerships as possible.&#xA0; Our ultimate vision is to permanently impact the career trajectories of the next generation of Hispanic entrepreneurs and corporate leaders.&#x201D;</p>\n"

Overuse of existing antibiotics has worsened the problem, resulting in an urgent need to develop new types of antimicrobial agents to combat the ever-increasing emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are developing synthetic antimicrobial materials that only target toxic bacteria and are biocompatible with healthy mammalian cells,&#x201D; said He Dong, the UTA associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry and joint associate professor of bioengineering who received the grant. &#x201C;These new molecules show great promise to treat infections not only on external surfaces or the skin like traditional antimicrobial peptides do, but also internally through oral or intravenous treatments, as they do not attack healthy human cells.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The earlier discovery of new antimicrobials based on small proteins or peptides had shown tremendous promise, but their widespread use and translation into clinical application was hampered by their toxicity toward a range of healthy human cells.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dong and her colleagues have taken this idea one step further by developing synthetic peptides that self-assemble into nanostructured fibers that can punch holes in the bacterial membrane, killing the pathogen,&#x201D; said Frederick MacDonnell, the chair of UTA&#x2019;s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. &#x201C;These synthetic self-assembling antimicrobial nanofibers, or SAANs, are the nucleus of a new therapeutic platform that could have a transformative impact on the multi-billion-dollar research industry around conventional antibiotics.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>This new grant builds on work done over the last three years by Dong around nanomaterials that can mimic nature and self-assemble into larger groups of molecules that have antimicrobial effects without hurting other healthy cells. The $456,985 grant is aimed at furthering the understanding of how SAANs are so effective against bacteria without harming healthy mammalian cells.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The multidisciplinary nature of this research, involving chemistry, microbiology, engineering, nanoscience and pharmaceutical sciences will also provide opportunities to train students at all levels,&#x201D; Dong added. &#x201C;We plan to collaborate closely with Dr. Liping Tang in UTA&#x2019;s bioengineering department to develop intelligent SAANs technologies that will permit highly effective and accurate disease-specific diagnoses and therapies in the future.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dong will soon be transferring to UTA&#x2019;s new 229,000-square-foot Science &amp; Engineering Innovation &amp; Research or SEIR building, a world-class research and teaching facility focused on health science research that is scheduled to open in July 2018. This facility will advance research at UTA by utilizing the modern concept of research lab neighborhoods to drive cross-disciplinary collaboration like Dong&#x2019;s research. Each of the 12 research lab neighborhoods will accommodate multiple teams in a wide range of fields, including biology, bioengineering, computational research, nursing and kinesiology.</p>\n<p>Dong came to UTA from Clarkson University, where she was an assistant professor of chemistry and biomolecular science. She earned her bachelor and master degrees in chemistry from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, and her doctorate in chemistry from Rice University in Houston. She did her first post-doctoral fellowship in the Department of Surgery at Emory University in Atlanta, and her second in materials science and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Dong&#x2019;s research exemplifies UTA&#x2019;s interdisciplinary approach to research, especially in the area of health and the human condition, one of four themes of the University&#x2019;s strategic plan,&#x201D; added MacDonnell. &#x201C;This early CAREER grant recognizes the potential of her research focus to make a real impact on the field.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Chiao.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our pH sensor is a very simple, biocompatible, flexible, inexpensively and easily mass-produced, and has a broad application across many sectors, including agriculture, cosmetics, medical devices and shipping logistics,&#x201D; Chiao said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;SensTek is now raising capital to demonstrate the viability of the prototypes and the manufacturing process for potential customers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Existing solutions in the pH market are usually bulky, expensive, high-power and complicated to use, often involving calibration and cleaning. The SensTek pH sensor is small, low-power and cost-effective for mobile applications, including wearables for biomedical applications or even custom cosmetics.</p>\n<p>In the cosmetics sectors, applications are seen to test for changes of skin pH with aging and during adolescence, including potential personalized skincare. Biomedical applications include using flexible sensors on the skin for smart bandages that detect acid or bacteria or to measures stress and sweat on athletes. The logistical sector is interested in sensors to provide information on the freshness of agricultural produce such as fish and fruits during transport and the agricultural sector to test soil acidity and wine quality.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA received equity in the company in partial exchange for the license grant and I received founder&#x2019;s equity for my role in the company,&#x201D; Chiao said. &#x201C;Collaboration with our alumna UTA Gloria&#xA0;Maceiko in Silicon Valley as well as our Office of Technology Management at UTA, brought together the ingredients for this success.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The pH sensor uses a very simple fabrication process and common nonhazardous materials, both of which are keys for mass production.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This process is low-cost and the end-product is biocompatible, which opens many doors, as it could potentially be implanted in the stomach or the brain, or onto any organ,&#x201D; Chiao said. &#x201C;Using printing we could potentially manufacture tens of thousands a day.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Teri Schultz, director of UTA&#x2019;s Office of Technology Management, emphasized that the business side of the startup is moving rapidly.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;SensTek is moving quickly to connect all the dots and move the product toward the market as soon as possible,&#x201D; Schultz said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a great example of how a patented invention by a faculty member can be licensed and moved toward prototyping fast enough to meet rising demand,&#x201D; she added.</p>\n<p>The pH sensor market is projecting high compounded growth rates of more than four percent annually up to 2023, reaching a $1.8 billion market globally, according to Market Research Future.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

He registered for the Capsim Challenge because &#x201C;I enjoy competing with students from other schools.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The biannual Capsim Challenge is open to all students who have completed a Capsim business simulation in the preceding semester and attracts thousands of competitors worldwide. The top six teams compete to see who can run the top corporation in a high pressure, zero sum environment. They are assessed using a Balanced Scorecard, ensuring the finalists succeed on a range of business parameters, not just the bottom line.</p>\n<p>According to Capsim President Reda Chafai, &#x201C;Descartes said understanding requires intuition and deduction, and a business simulation provides practice in both. It has the financial information students need to deduce what the competition is doing &#x2013; and how to respond &#x2013; and offers the experience they need to develop their business intuition. Ryan has demonstrated he has what it takes to make a great manager &#x2013; one who understands business from many different angles.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Luke Courtright, coordinator of the Capsim Challenge, said, &#x201C;There is an impressive level of professionalism and dedication in our finalists. They enter the competition on their own time, at a very busy time of year, and give it all they&#x2019;ve got. Winners like Ryan show they can work in a pressured environment, making decisions, analyzing data, and getting results fast.

But if matter and antimatter are produced equally, then all of the matter created in the early universe should have been cancelled out by equal amounts of antimatter, eliminating existence itself instantly. And we would not exist.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>To explain this asymmetry, some particle physicists claim that the tiny subatomic particle, the neutrino, and its antimatter particle, the antineutrino, are in fact the same particle. This might account for the overall excess of matter in the universe as a whole&#x2014; and why we are here.</p>\n<p>UTA researchers are now taking advantage of a biochemistry technique that uses fluorescence to detect ions to identify the product of a radioactive decay called neutrinoless double-beta decay that would demonstrate that the neutrino is its own antiparticle.</p>\n<p>Radioactive decay is the breakdown of an atomic nucleus releasing energy and matter from the nucleus. Ordinary double-beta decay is an unusual mode of radioactivity in which a nucleus emits two electrons and two antineutrinos at the same time. However, if neutrinos and antineutrinos are in fact identical, then the two antineutrinos can cancel each other, resulting in what is termed a neutrinoless decay, with all of the energy given to the two electrons.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>To find this neutrinoless double-beta decay, scientists are looking at a very rare event that occurs about once a year, when a xenon atom decays and converts to barium. If a neutrinoless double-beta decay has occurred, you would expect to find a barium ion in coincidence with two electrons of the right total energy. &#xA0;UTA researchers&#x2019; proposed new detector precisely would permit identifying this single barium ion accompanying pairs of electrons created within large quantities of xenon gas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If we observe even one such event, it would be a profound discovery in particle physics, on par with the discovery of the Higgs boson,&#x201D; said Ben Jones, UTA assistant professor of physics, who is leading this research for the American branch of the Neutrino Experiment with Xenon TPC - Time Projection Chamber or NEXT program, which&#xA0;searches for neutrinoless double-beta decay.&#xA0;Other UTA researchers also collaborated on the ATLAS experiment, which led to the Nobel Prize winning discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012.</p>\n<p>The researchers, who published their discovery Monday in <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.132504\">Physical Review Letters</a>, have demonstrated the effectiveness of their technique on a small scale and now plan to use the device in a large-scale detector, which they envision as a chamber containing a ton of high-pressure, purified xenon gas.</p>\n<p>David Nygren, UTA Presidential Distinguished Professor of Physics and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, had the idea to look at fluorescence when he realized how neuroscientists use the technique to look at calcium ions that jump from neuron to neuron in the brain.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I realized that calcium and barium are not so different, so perhaps we could use the same technique to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay,&#x201D; Nygren said.</p>\n<p>Early research with UTA graduate student Austin McDonald identified a chemical compound called FLUO-3 that not only works with calcium ions but is also sensitive to barium. From there, the team devised a device that could reveal barium ions in a large volume of gaseous xenon, which was proven in the published paper.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The beauty of this research is that it brings together physicists and chemists to generate creative new solutions to enable discoveries in fundamental physics,&#x201D; said UTA physics chair Alex Weiss. &#x201C;This work also clearly demonstrates the ability of students and faculty at UTA to lead the way in international physics projects and represents an important example of the world-class research enabled by UTA&#x2019;s focus on data-driven discovery.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Enders Fellowship and Research Grant.</p>\n<p>She has taught undergraduate classes in Public History, Black Women in the U.S., the American South, the Modern United States and African American History until 1863. Her graduate teaching has focused on slavery, abolition and modern African American history.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Gerald Jaynes, professor of economics and African American Studies at Yale, said, &#x201C;Black cooperative enterprises challenged state-sponsored discrimination, black economic deprivation, and in the larger realm of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, struggle for racial equality provided a framework for African American economic protest.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In her current book project, Price draws upon business records, statistics of sales, profit and loss, and historical documents such as sermons, speeches, papers of educators and articles in the African American press.</p>\n<p>Jaynes said, &#x201C;We still know relatively little about the group economic aspirations and ventures of the freed slaves and their immediate progeny during the period between the end of reconstruction and the beginning of the Great Migration about 1910. Dr. Price&#x2019;s work promises to illuminate that story.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Price joins an accomplished team of scholar-teachers in the Department of History. Leading experts in their respective fields, the department&#x2019;s interdisciplinary faculty have been recognized for their path-breaking scholarship through fellowships and grants from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, American Council of Learned Societies, British Library, National Endowment for the Humanities, and National Humanities Center, among many others.

UTA&#x2019;s internationally renowned faculty and dedicated staff maintain a clear focus on providing the very best academic experience possible to every student, ensuring that the University meets the state&#x2019;s needs for highly skilled intellectual capital and a career-ready workforce. Enrollment in UTA&#x2019;s undergraduate engineering programs continues to improve.</p>\n<p>With the creation of a one-stop Graduation Help Desk program last fall and other college completion initiatives, UTA is demonstrating strong commitment to helping students earn their degree on time and at an affordable cost. <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> ranks UTA No. 1 among national public universities for graduating students with the least amount of debt in its &#x201C;Best Colleges: 2018&#x201D; list.</p>\n<p>UTA is one of an elite group of 115 institutions including Harvard, MIT and Johns Hopkins to achieve the Carnegie R-1: Doctoral University Highest Research Activity designation.

U.S. News &amp; World Report is a recognized leader in higher education rankings.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s School of Social Work is steadily gaining recognition as one of the best social work programs in the country,&#x201D; said UTA President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;We have become a recognized destination university for social work students not only in North Texas or our state, but the nation and even the world.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>School of Social Work Dean Scott Ryan attributed part of the program&#x2019;s success on UTA&#x2019;s commitment to enabling students to gain real experience through research carried with faculty in the community, which results in a strong placement record for students immediately upon graduation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our students get the chance to not only learn from the great minds represented through our faculty but also participate in community projects that professors are undertaking. That research gives students an extra opportunity to impress future employers with their practical experience, which is vital in our field,&#x201D; Ryan said.</p>\n<p>UTA estimates that more than 90 percent of the 115 masters and doctoral students graduating this spring will have positions in the workforce upon leaving the University.</p>\n<p>Funding for School of Social Work research projects is also steadily increasing, with grants awarded growing from $1.9 million to $3.06 million between 2014 and 2017. Research expenditures, a measure of funds directly spent on projects, also increased from $2.3 million to $3.6 million over the last four years, a 36 percent increase.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This increased funding means we are also better prepared to carry out more projects with students, and also results in greater recognition for our faculty as a leading research institution,&#x201D; Ryan said. &#x201C;Having that validation from your peers is especially gratifying.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Another indicator of the success of UTA&#x2019;s numerous joint student-faculty collaborations was reflected in the large number of presentations made by the School at the 2018 Society for Social Work and Research Conference in Washington in January, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diane Mitschke, director of the graduate programs, and graduate student Nabiba Hasan, presented their work on religion as a source of strength for recently resettled refugees from Syria</li>\n<li>Social work doctoral student, Marcus Crawford, and assistant dean for research and faculty affairs, Holli Slater, gave a presentation on outcomes for youth aging out of foster care</li>\n<li>Cecilia Mengo and Youn Kyoung (Lily) Kim, who both graduated from the UTA doctoral program in social work in 2016 and are now teaching at other universities, gave a presentation on research they conducted with UTA social work associate professor, Eusebius Small, on peer affiliation, school bullying victimization and substance misuse among adolescents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>State Rep. Toni Rose, D-Dallas, added that the work of UTA&#x2019;s School of Social Work is reflected in the community it serves.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Some of the UTA projects help non-profits and charitable organizations that serve people in our communities who are hurt or need help,&#x201D; said Rep. Rose.</p>\n<p>U.S. News &amp; World Report considers factors such as evidence of excellence in faculty and students as well as reputation including surveys of peers in compiling its annual rankings.</p>\n<p>In addition to the School of Social Work in the U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings, the College of Engineering is now ranked in the Top 100 of all engineering schools being evaluated.</p>\n<p>Recently, UTA also placed No. 10 in the nation among online schools for education majors according to BestCollegeReviews.org. UTA was recognized for offering multiple start dates for students&#x2019; convenience, including a nine-month superintendent certificate available entirely online. OnlineDegrees.com also ranked UTA No. 6 in a new study of all Texas colleges offering online degrees, crediting the University for affordability, flexibility and student services.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

UTAPD also launched MavWatch, a program that places students on patrol to provide courtesy escorts, assist visitors, report safety concerns and act as an additional set of eyes and ears looking for unusual activity. The department&#x2019;s annual National Night Out event has been recognized five consecutive years by the National Association of Town Watch.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTAPD is a leading agency in campus policing.

One was a rockshelter at Pinnacle Point where people lived &#x2013; sleeping at night, cooking food and sharing stories around the campfire. The others were at an open-air site just nine kilometers away, a location where humans collected stone and processed it for future tool manufacture.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Finding the shards from Toba at these two sites means that we can link the sites at a temporal precision of about two weeks and say that the people at the sites were almost certainly of the same social group, and link activities at one site to the other,&#x201D; Cleghorn said. &#x201C;For archaeologists, that is an extraordinary result.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/2017-07-06-105615.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>A view of the Knysna archaeological project.

After working on Pinnacle Point for four years she began research at her current site at Knysna, about 80 kilometers east of Pinnacle Point.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We know that shortly after Toba, modern humans left Africa and conquered the planet,&#x201D; Cleghorn added. &#x201C;My work at Pinnacle Point and now at Knysna aims to develop a high-resolution chronology of human evolution and social adaptation during that time.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The Toba shards provide a very reliable and precise means to date sites and could help tie together the chronologies of many sites across Southern Africa. Once two sites were identified, the process is extending to other sites, including Knysna, Cleghorn&#x2019;s current dig.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s support was instrumental in getting Cleghorn&#x2019;s project started at Knysna. Cleghorn used a Research Enhancement Program grant to run the initial test excavation, which provided the evidence needed to attract external funding for the project over several years from the Leakey Foundation, National Science Foundation, Templeton Foundation and Hyde Family Foundation. The College of Liberal Arts also supported research into mineral pigment use at the Knysna site.</p>\n<p>So far, some dozen UTA students have participated in the Knysna field project, and this year Cleghorn is taking five current or former UTA students into the field with significant funding support.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Naomi Cleghorn&#x2019;s work is foundational to paleosciences and her significant funding also demonstrates the value that leading foundations give to her work,&#x201D; said Elizabeth Cawthon, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Liberal Arts. &#x201C;It is also cross-disciplinary work linking UTA&#x2019;s strategic themes of global environmental impact and sustainable urban communities.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

This dynamic company is breaking new ground in a field of research that has the potential for developing a menu of antibody-based therapies that could benefit much larger numbers of cancer patients.</p>\n<p>Boehringer Ingelheim also awarded AbeXXa the company&#x2019;s Innovation Prize. The impact of this combination of events has enabled AbeXXa to accelerate its plans and grow its team of scientists from Texas to Boston, where AbeXXa now has a space at LabCentral&#x2019;s shared laboratory space in Cambridge &#x2013; the prize for winning the Innovation competition.</p>\n<p>Jon Weidanz, co-founder of AbeXXa, biology professor and associate vice president of research and interim director of UTA&#x2019;s North Texas Genome Center, underlined the significance of Boehringer Ingelheim&#x2019;s involvement in AbeXXa.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In just a little over a year, we&#x2019;ve become operational and, through the significant support of Boehringer Ingelheim, we have pulled something together that&#x2019;s very special. We&#x2019;re bringing our unique technology and know-how together with Boehringer Ingelheim&#x2019;s discovery and development expertise,&#x201D; Weidanz said. &#x201C;Everything has been set up for AbeXXa to be very successful and this, to a great extent, is due to the confidence that Boehringer Ingelheim has in our science and our team. We hope that through this partnership, together we will be able to apply our innovative science to reimagine the future of cancer treatment.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b>A menu-based approach to treatment </b></p>\n<p>What makes AbeXXa&#x2019;s research different is its effective treatment for a majority of patients by providing multiple combination options, tailored to each patient&#x2019;s tumor. Weidanz has worked in the immuno-oncology field for more than 25 years exploring how to utilize the immune system to attack cancer cells. &#x201C;Our idea was to go back and re-interrogate the immune system and explore which molecules are critical at regulating immune responses.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>AbeXXa&#x2019;s innovative approach is to tap into the diverse set of cancer-specific proteins that are contained within the cell, rather than just those that are expressed on the membrane. Other companies with research interests in this area focus on classical Human Leucocyte Antigens, or HLAs &#x2013; those that present antigens in a way that depend on the genetics of each person. AbeXXa is honing in on atypical HLAs which have much less variability.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This means we can envision therapies that target large numbers of patients with a particular cancer,&#x201D; Weidanz explains. &#x201C;We&apos;re finding a growing list of peptides that are presented by atypical HLAs. If you develop a number of antibody-based therapies against these, the patient&#x2019;s treatment will be an individualized combination of these therapies to suit their individual tumor signature.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b>Strong relationship with global pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim</b></p>\n<p>Relationships matter.</p>\n<p>And from the outset, Weidanz wanted to work with a partner he could trust in the journey to translate the scientific hypotheses into practice.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s about the network. You have a group of people you feel confident reaching out to who have been supportive over the years and through our long-standing relationship and alignment in goals, AbeXXa was the fit that Boehringer Ingelheim was looking for,&#x201D; Weidanz said.</p>\n<p>Cancer immunology is a major research focus for Boehringer Ingelheim, which has substantially increased its investment in this area and recently formed a new, global research department dedicated to exploring new ways of directing the immune system to profoundly affect the course of cancer.</p>\n<p>Set against this backdrop, the idea was born to invest in a company through the Boehringer Ingelheim Venture Fund, which could develop this early and challenging area of science. In parallel, the discovery research team also was exploring opportunities for collaboration. AbeXXa fit the bill on both counts.</p>\n<p>Paul Adam, head of Cancer Immunology Target Discovery within Boehringer Ingelheim, recognizes the partnership sweet spot with AbeXXa.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We saw very early on that AbeXXa was a company we could do great science with. We have a long-term commitment to oncology, and this opportunity to discover novel therapeutic antibodies supports our innovation strategy of exploring new target spaces. Our relationship with AbeXXa plays to each company&#x2019;s strengths and is a great example of how we can use a combination of investment and partnership tools to support early science innovation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Weidanz describes the partnership as a meeting of minds.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;One of the great things that AbeXXa has with Boehringer Ingelheim is a unique trust which starts with the leadership. We see a lot of support in trying to make the project work and a lot of intellectual input and exchange,&#x201D; Weidanz said. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s an academic feel to the relationship in terms of being inquisitive, curious and creative, but with a collegial approach to solving the problem &#x2013;&#xA0; how do we defeat cancer?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>National Council of Entrepreneurial Tech Transfer <a href=\"https://ncet2.org/\">https://ncet2.org/</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>&#xA0;</b></p>\n"

It will be announced at the National Conference in Chicago later this month.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This designation and relationship will only strengthen UTA&#x2019;s ability to reach out to Hispanic students,&#x201D; UTA Provost Teik C. Lim said. &#x201C;We will receive examples on best practices among institutions that have been serving Hispanic students for years. We also hope to share what works for UTA with other institutions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The University of Texas at Arlington became a Hispanic Serving Institution in 2014 when it met U.S. Department of Education requirements. HSI is a status that makes it eligible for federal grants supporting and strengthening institutions with large numbers of Hispanic students. A school must have a Hispanic population of at least 25 percent full-time undergraduate enrollment to qualify for the designation. At the time, UTA was the highest-profile public research university in North Texas to receive the designation and one of about 300 nationally.</p>\n<p>Martinez-Cosio said she is elated to serve on the national board.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The alliance exists to serve the nation&#x2019;s Hispanic Serving Institutions,&#x201D; Martinez-Cosio said. &#x201C;There is strength in numbers. Not only will UTA benefit from networking, conferences and best practices, but we might collaborate with other Hispanic Serving Institutions that could fortify grants we apply for.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Martinez-Cosio, who was one of just four North Texas women honored by Ford Motor Company with a Mujeres Legendarias Award recently, leads a 2015 U.S. Department of Education grant that aims to enhance services and increase graduation and retention rates among lower-income and Hispanic students. The five-year, $2.62 million grant established the UTA IDEAS Center, which stands for Innovation, Diversity, Excellence, Access and Success.</p>\n<p>The IDEAS Center is located in UTA&#x2019;s Central Library and offers access to support services for students in transition, particularly transfer students, veterans and those from underserved populations. The grant also provides funding for professional development of faculty members, exposing them to innovative methods of teaching to help them build connections with first-generation students.</p>\n<div></div>\n"

These traits, which often include a period of time of isolation or submissiveness, are often referred to as the &#x201C;loser&#x201D; effect.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;To date there are no studies that have documented the changes in gene expression from the time an individual loses a conflict and changes behavior to the time when he or she recovers,&#x201D; Herzog said. &#x201C;Finding out the molecular basis of the mechanism that produces the malaise and the switch that returns them to normal could have wide-ranging applications across multiple species.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Herzog&#x2019;s interest in this issue grew from her experiences as a military veteran who also worked extensively with military personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with combat-induced Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Many of these veterans show the same behaviors,&#x201D; Herzog said. &#x201C;I am hoping that over the long-term, this work could contribute to helping them recover from combat-related stress disorders.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Herzog is studying the broad-horned flour beetle, <i>Gnatoceros cornutus</i>, an insect that fights other males for access to mating opportunities. When these insects experience social defeat, they go into a malaise for a few days and then return to normal activities, continuing to fight their peers for mates.</p>\n<p>In the research project, Herzog plans to extract and sequence the RNA of beetles who lose fights and compare them to beetles that have not fought, using an Ilumina sequencing platform from UTA&#x2019;s new research resource, the North Texas Genome Center.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The North Texas Genome Center&#x2019;s high-quality sequencing equipment will allow me to identify the genes and the proteins associated with the &#x201C;loser&#x201D; effect and recovery,&#x201D; Herzog said. &#x201C;By studying these genetic components of behavior, I will be able to provide answers not only for the biological sciences but potentially across other disciplines such as psychology and sociology, environmental science, resource management and education.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Herzog&#x2019;s mentor, associate professor of biology Jeffery Demuth, was among the first to congratulate her on this impressive achievement.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Marquerite&#x2019;s approach to studying the genetic components of behavior highlights the central role of genomics in the modern research enterprise, encompassing a number of UTA&#x2019;s strategic theme areas like data-driven discovery and health and the human condition,&#x201D; Demuth said. &#x201C;Gaining expertise in this burgeoning field will no doubt benefit both her and the university going forward.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The GRFP provides three years of financial support within a five-year fellowship period ($34,000 annual stipend and $12,000 cost-of-education allowance to the institution).</p>\n"

The Dombroski era will be exciting for two reasons &#x2013; it shows UTA&#x2019;s commitment to modernizing how students are taught, and his extensive experience in the corporate sector will give students a real-world view of the business world and help them get off to a fast start in whatever field they choose.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Dombroski is eager to begin his new position at the College of Business. With his extensive ties to corporations in the area, he looks forward to expanding UTA&#x2019;s relationships with community partners. His multipronged approach to positioning the University as a nucleus of the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex will benefit UTA students with increased opportunities for internships and career entry and will further leverage the scholarship and expertise of its faculty to being the thought leaders for the region and nation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is always an intrinsic blessing to come full circle in one&#x2019;s career. When I graduated from UTA in 1979, I was prepped and ready to enter the workforce,&#x201D; Dombroski said. &#x201C;The education that I received at UTA was the spark that fueled a long, rewarding career. I look forward to being able to pay that back to current UTA students and future graduates.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s commitment to greater engagement with the corporate world, focus on being the very best through transformative changes and modernizing offerings based on the needs of the workforce was a key reason for his appointment.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Harry doesn&#x2019;t come from the traditional academic side of the house. However, he has been very engaged with our faculty and students over many years,&#x201D; said Teik C.

Victoria Messerschmidt and Zach Bailey, two doctoral students, and Richard Bryant, who is seeking his master&#x2019;s degree, are helping Lee on the project.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are trying to understand biological forces through engineering,&#x201D; Lee said. &#x201C;This research is still in its basic stages, but what we learn now could someday allow doctors to pre-identify heart abnormalities and diagnose congenital heart conditions that could then be treated with gene therapy.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Lee must build his microscope because none are commercially available that can capture 3-D motion plus time. Once it is built, he will inject the zebrafish with nanoparticles that attach where certain genes are expressed and track how genes affect ventricular development. He is using zebrafish because their bodies are transparent in the embryonic stage, so it is easy to see the nanoparticles without the use of magnetic resonance imaging.</p>\n<p>Lee will use his new microscope to create a 4-D model of a beating heart based on the images and genetic information collected from the fish, then apply computation models to that data to test his findings.</p>\n<p>This will include modifying the genes and using them to modulate contraction and hemodynamics or blood flow to see how changes in biomechanical forces affect gene development and then chamber development. In response to hemodynamic forces, ridges and grooves form in a wavelike pattern called a trabecular network in the direction of the blood flow. Too much or too little trabeculation can lead to defects with high mortality rates.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If we can understand the effects of biomechanical forces on the genes that cause ventricular chamber development, we can discern the optimized shape of the ventricle and best contraction rate. From there, it could be possible to change the levels of gene expressions,&#x201D; Lee said.</p>\n<p>Lee&#x2019;s work is the latest example of UTA&#x2019;s research in cardiac health in support of health and the human condition, a key tenet of the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Michael Cho, professor and Alfred R. and Janet H. Potvin Endowed Chair of the Bioengineering Department.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Even in its early stages, Dr. Lee&#x2019;s work is exciting in its potential for making large strides in correcting cardiac defects in the future,&#x201D; Cho said. &#x201C;This research will offer critical insight into how the heart forms and the biomechanical factors that affect cardiac growth, and that knowledge will allow better research into potentially life-saving techniques down the road.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Other recent examples of UTA research in cardiac health include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Nelson, assistant professor of kinesiology, is using a $3.3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the link between fat storage in the heart and cardiovascular disease, as well as the influence of gender on the development of cardiac dysfunction.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Bioengineering Professor Kytai Nguyen earned a National Institutes of Health T-32 grant totaling more than $1 million over five years to recruit and train outstanding doctoral students in nanotechnology and nanomedicine related to cardiovascular and pulmonary issues.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Mark Haykowsky, a cardiovascular exercise scientist in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, received a $308,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health to study exercise intolerance in older heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Yi Hong, an assistant professor in the Bioengineering Department, was awarded a $211,000 R21 grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop materials that will allow doctors to use a 3-D printer to create unique new blood vessels for children with vascular defects.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- Written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n"

The CLEAR research team determined that under a wide range of conditions, multiple treatment modalities were required to remove pertinent contaminants, the presence of which can preclude oilfield waste from being recycled and reused.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As hydrocarbon extraction has expanded considerably across Texas, particularly in western Texas, so too has the reliance on fresh water resources to facilitate the stimulation of production wells,&#x201D; said Kevin Schug, interim associate dean of the College of Science and Director of CLEAR. &#x201C;This has provided a tremendous impetus for the recycling and reuse of produced waste, both of which are very difficult to accomplish effectively and economically given the physiochemical complexities of these waste solutions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Through this partnership with Challenger Water Solutions, we have been able to assess important organic, inorganic and biological constituents throughout the multi-step process, whereby we found that waste streams could be transformed into a resource for reuse by the oil and gas industry,&#x201D; he said.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s ongoing efforts will include developing therapies for the treatment of harmful bacteria in the water that are resistant to traditional forms of disinfection,&#x201D; added Dr. Zacariah Hildenbrand, co-founder and scientific contributor to CLEAR.&#xA0; A sponsored research agreement, the second within a year, from CWS to CLEAR, will pave the way for the development of new technology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Sulfate-reducing and iron-oxidizing bacteria are just two classes of bacteria that can wreak havoc in the oil and gas industry,&#x201D; Hildenbrand said. &#x201C;Bacterial contaminants can produce biofilms and corrosive agents, which can affect production and deteriorate infrastructure. The targeted chemical-free treatments that we are developing will not only ensure that recycled produced water is reusable, but they may also enhance oilfield recovery in production wells where biofouling is problematic.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&quot;The dynamic variable of produced water requires&#xA0;the best and brightest to break the barriers of cost, quality and consistency. Challenger Water Solutions has received validation and an&#xA0;expanded technology portfolio&#xA0;through the revolutionary thinking and expertise of UTA&apos;s multidisciplinary team,&quot; said Joel Warner, Technology Development Lead at Challenger Water Solutions.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These efforts clearly have tremendous implications in terms of greater environmental stewardship within the oil and gas industry,&#x201D; Schug concluded.</p>\n<p>To learn more about their work, visit <a href=\"http://clear.uta.edu\">http://clear.uta.edu</a></p>\n"

This approach will allow them to build a generic system that possibly combines government space programs like NASA and private space companies with military space programs. The resulting toolbox and people-integration environment will allow planners to look broadly at issues of defensible space, space exploration and space colonization that could affect the United States down the road. Key to such space infrastructure is cost-effective transportation - how to get into space, move in space and the upper atmosphere, and return. This could include the possibility of launching spacecraft from the moon or an asteroid for future manned and unmanned space missions.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;By enriching the planners forecasting toolbox, we will effect military spending strategies, technology investments in hypersonic speed, reusable space launch, artificial intelligence and other activities,&#x201D; Chudoba said. &#x201C;To run transportation planning scenarios well, they must be able to correctly identify not just vehicles, but associated costs, political issues and environmental variables as well.

Inc., an RC21X<sup> </sup>subsidiary, have signed a licensing agreement to use Kondraske&#x2019;s General Systems Performance Theory, the framework by which RC21X&#x2019;s tools &#x2013; the clinical version of GPST and mobile application Roberto &#x2013; measure a person&#x2019;s brain performance.</p>\n<p>Kondraske and RC21X have enlisted researchers in the medical and academic worlds as partners. They have signed or are in contract negotiations with former professional athletes, members of the professional sports community, public schools, college athletic programs, insurance companies and individuals suffering from brain diseases like dementia or Alzheimer&#x2019;s as clients.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We see this company and technology as real breakthroughs in determining where people&#x2019;s brains are at a specific point in time,&#x201D; said Kondraske, who started at UTA in 1982. &#x201C;We see everyone as a potential user of this system. Basically, if you have a brain, you can access and use this tool.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Clarence Carlos, CEO and co-founder of RC21X, assembled his team and started the company after a friend&#x2019;s teenaged son died from a misdiagnosed brain injury. There were no tools that provided a quick comparison to previous performance levels. &#x201C;This is very personal for me,&#x201D; Carlos said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;With this agreement, we&#x2019;re going to be able to help a lot of people all over the world,&#x201D; Carlos said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re giving people access to new data about their brain. We say you can&#x2019;t manage what you don&#x2019;t measure. Now people will have objective data. Now they can make smarter decisions about their brain and see how its performance impacts everything they do.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Kondraske said most brain performance tools on the market today only look at concussion results or what&#x2019;s been harmed. Many times, these tools also use highly subjective measures to account for differences in individuals&#x2019; brains.</p>\n<p>That&#x2019;s where Kondraske&#x2019;s inventive process comes into play. Together, Kondraske and RC21X have designed a way to evaluate everyone&#x2019;s brain on equal footing.</p>\n<p>The unique approach to neurocognitive/neuromotor measurement and monitoring of brain performance capacities uses the science of General Systems Performance Theory, which was developed by Kondraske. In this systems approach, a human being can be viewed as a set of sub-systems, each of which possesses a certain amount of different types of performance resources. RC21X is designed to maximally stress selected sub-systems and determine &#x201C;how much&#x201D; of a given performance resource is available. The array of human performance resources targeted by RC21X is based on brain structure and function, and includes many of those that are drawn upon and that support performance in the more complex activities of everyday life.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;GSPT tells us how to develop the performance measures,&#x201D; Kondraske said. &#x201C;It allows us to make tasks that are target specific so we get an accurate picture of where different peoples brains are without having to change the test.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Kondraske has spent decades studying human performance as director of UTA&#x2019;s Human Performance Institute.</p>\n<p>By incorporating GSPT, RC21X can provide new insights to brain performance&#x2014;especially by combining multiple performance measures. GSPT is particularly sensitive to detecting changes in human performance over time.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;That trending information is extremely valuable,&#x201D; Carlos said. &#x201C;It crosses many sectors and industries. Once users create their normal ranges, they generate performance data that can be easily accessed in case of an injury or illness.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Gus Frerotte, RC21X&#x2019;s president of business development, is a 15-year NFL veteran. He said that the tools&#x2019; focus on performance rather than diagnostics is important.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;You can be proactive rather than reactive. Maybe you have children who play sports, or aging parents or you&#x2019;re taking a new medication &#x2013; all of these things impact your brain or the brain of someone you care about,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;Now, you can have some objective information and make better lifestyle decisions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Duane Dimos, UTA vice president of research, said one of the more exciting aspects of the agreement is the development of the <a href=\"http://robertoapp.com/index.php\">Roberto cell phone app</a>. He said the agreement drills directly into two of the University&#x2019;s main themes of health and the human condition, and data-driven discovery as stated in its <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The app makes the technology that much more marketable,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;Everyone has access to a cell phone, not only individual users but also healthcare providers who need to access the app for patients.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">About George Kondraske</span></b></p>\n<p>Kondraske has authored more than 250 published works.

They also modified the nanoparticles with tumor targeting properties and then loaded the nanoparticles with a chemotherapy drug.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is precision medicine,&#x201D; said Zui Pan, an associate professor of nursing and one of the corresponding authors of a paper on this nanoparticle, which is scheduled to be published in&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04763-y\" target=\"_blank\">the journal Nature Communications</a> this month. &#x201C;It is harder to detect the esophageal cancer tumor. One common detection method is the use of an endoscopic probe, which shines a white light through your throat. But the problem is the tumor is embedded in the normal tissue and difficult to see. This will help detect the tumor and guide the surgeon to the area that is lit up and surgically remove it, or consider alternative therapies.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Esophageal cancer, the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, is responsible for nearly 16,000 deaths in the United States each year, according to the American Cancer Society. It has few symptoms and is often diagnosed at a later stage. The five-year survival rate is less than 20 percent.</p>\n<p>Pan, a leading esophageal cancer researcher, heads a lab that is largely devoted to the study and treatment of the disease. Other collaborators on this study include Mingjun Zhang, a professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at The Ohio State University, and his postdoctoral fellow Zhen Fan; Yan Chang, a post-doctoral fellow in Pan&#x2019;s lab and Chaochu Chi, a graduate student who is also in Pan&#x2019;s lab.</p>\n<p>The researchers began developing this nanoparticle in 2015, Pan said. She added that in addition to making it easier to see the tumor, the nanoparticle has the ability to carry the chemotherapy drug to the site.</p>\n<p>The nanoparticle is injected into the body, travels through the blood stream and accumulates in the tumor area because of its targeting properties, Pan said.</p>\n<p>Pan said that in the past there have been some concerns about attempting to use nanoparticles detecting cancer cells because of the potential to introduce unanticipated side effects. It is important to note that this nanoparticle is both biocompatible and biodegradable.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a significant milestone in cancer research, particularly esophageal cancer research,&#x201D; said Anne Bavier, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation. &#x201C;It is potentially transformative and further builds on the college and the university&#x2019;s efforts to advance <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\" target=\"_blank\">health and the human condition</a>.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>This is Pan&#x2019;s second breakthrough in esophageal cancer research in the last 12 months. Last fall, <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/09/zui-pan-zinc-cancer-research.php\" target=\"_blank\">she published a study in the FASEB Journal</a> that showed that zinc can inhibit the growth of esophageal cancer cells. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The long term goal of my research is to help prevent this tumor and to find better, safer and more targeted treatments for esophageal cancer,&#x201D; Pan said. &#x201C;This is a big step toward that goal.&#x201D;</p>\n"

They were out of time. It wasn&#x2019;t a question of when. It was a question of how.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Now, the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, has signed a five-year, $4 million agreement with Hossain to solve the one major issue for their country &#x2013; growing demand for sustainable urban development.</p>\n<p>As part of sustainable urban development, solving waste management issues due to the exponential rise of city&#x2019;s population is a critical component for future growth of Addis Ababa.</p>\n<p>The agreement is a collaboration between The University of Texas at Arlington and Kotebe Metropolitan University and the city of Addis Ababa. Through the collaboration, UTA&#x2019;s SWIS will help and promote Addis Ababa&#x2019;s waste management facility to become a Center of Excellence. As part of the agreement SWIS will hire and educate two post-doctorate researchers and five doctoral students each of those five years.</p>\n<p>Hossain will work with the Addis Ababa city officials and KMU to enroll the post-docs and doctoral students, and identify the city&#x2019;s need to start research projects that will have a lasting impact on their home country of Ethiopia.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We can concentrate on landfill management projects that can immediately benefit and help Ethiopia,&#x201D; said Hossain, who added that Addis Ababa currently has 3.5 million residents but should have close to 10 million in the next decade. &#x201C;They need action now.&#x201D;</p>\n<div></div>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt=\"Ethiopian delegates recently visited UTA\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/hossain-and-ethiopians-51818.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Ethiopian delegates recently visited UTA to meet with Univeristy officials.

The institute combines science, engineering and social science expertise in developing new methodologies and solutions in order to explore international paths to sustainable waste management. SWIS&#x2019; goal is to work for a better future by developing sustainable solid waste management that incorporates the economy, people and environment, which will be beneficial to all cities in Texas, the country and internationally. SWIS conducts a winter training/education conference which has drawn participants from more than 60 countries.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is the global outreach of SWIS and UTA,&#x201D; Hossain said. &#x201C;And the project with Ethiopia doesn&#x2019;t only include solid waste management. It also includes street engineering, traffic management, urban planning, city management and other major topics.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>That&#x2019;s why Hossain is envisioning collaboration within the Civil Engineering Department and other departments within UTA.</p>\n<p>Dr. Araya Asfaw, former director of Horn of Africa Regional Environmental Center &#xA0;and founder/managing partner of the sustainability advisory group, said he is excited about the collaboration with UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our people will be learning cutting-edge technology in maintaining and managing landfills, and sustainable waste management system,&#x201D; Araya said. &#x201C;We will benefit immediately from what they learn here at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Araya is the city of Addis Ababa&#x2019;s consultant for the project.</p>\n<p>Ali Abolmaali, chair of the Civil Engineering Department, said Dr. Hossain&#x2019;s work will have a lasting impact on Ethiopian residents.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;What he is doing with the country today could influence what happens in that country for decades to come, It has global impact,&#x201D; Abolmaali said. &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll see changes in those residents&#x2019; lives well beyond the physical infrastructure we&#x2019;ll train for in the classroom with the doctoral students and post-doc researchers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Duane Dimos, UTA&#x2019;s vice president for research, said the work done now will save lives in the long run.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We cannot let what happened in 2017, happen anymore,&#x201D; Dimos said. &#x201C;This university caters to the needs of a major metropolitan area in North Texas. That expertise and learned experiences need to be shared with the world and Dr. Hossain has done that and is continuing to do that in his Solid Waste Institute for Sustainability.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>SWIS is a classroom for solid waste management and landfill mining. Hossain has received grants from various cities and state agencies that installs sensors in landfills to tell the operator how much water to apply so that decomposition can create gas used to power nearby homes.</p>\n<p>Hossain also has a project with the Texas Department of Transportation that uses pins made of recycled plastic to spike into failed highway slopes, which in turn makes those slopes stronger.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s SWIS is an Organized Research Center of Excellence. Hossain has organized the winter school for the last three years in collaboration with the International Solid Waste Association. The objective of the ISWA-SWIS winter school is to provide advanced knowledge in the field of waste management to an international audience of existing and emerging solid waste experts. Participants from more than 60 counties joined the winter school last three years.</p>\n"

The upgrade by North Star Imaging includes the new generation X-ray tube and detectors among other hardware enabling unprecedented three-dimensional imaging quality and efficiency.</p>\n<p>Erian Armanios, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, indicated the high visibility of Makeev&#x2019;s research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The Advanced Materials and Structures Lab is continuing its stellar trajectory for making breakthroughs in diagnostics and prognosis of composites,&#x201D; Armanios said. &#x201C;UTA is becoming the go-to destination for pioneering work serving the aerospace industry and government labs with novel solutions to timely technical challenges.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The research dovetails nicely in with the University&#x2019;s Strategic Plan, including one of the pillars of that plan: data-driven discovery.</p>\n<p>Duane Dimos, UTA&#x2019;s vice president for research, said Makeev&#x2019;s research is a great example of UTA projects reaching out of the laboratory and into the real world.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;When industry begins seeking out what UTA is doing, that&#x2019;s collaboration that is built to last,&#x201D; Dimos said.</p>\n<p>The Advanced Materials and Structures Lab has quickly become a world-class organization with a critical mass of researchers empowered by state-of-the-art facilities. The lab enables a shift from relying on the traditional time-consuming trial and error experimentation loops and empiricism in the design of composite materials and structures, to efficient diagnostics and prognosis methods. These rely upon three-dimensional imaging and performance prediction based on accurate computational tools.</p>\n<p>AMSL&#x2019;s recent research accomplishments have appeared in more than 25 articles in the top refereed journals in the field; and recognized by six &#x201C;best paper&#x201D; awards at national and international conferences including the Cheeseman Award at the 36<sup>th</sup> European Rotorcraft Forum. It is the first and only time the award was presented to authors based in the United States. The lab also earned American Helicopter Society Forum best papers in structures and materials in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017; and the American Society for Composites best paper award in 2013.</p>\n<p>Makeev has brought in nearly $3 million during the last couple of years from governmental agencies and private companies in the defense contractor sector.</p>\n"

Co-principal investigators are Sarah Rose, associate professor of history and director of the disability studies minor, Julienne Greer, an assistant professor in theatre arts, Manfred Huber, professor of computer science and engineering, and Vassilis Athitsos, associate professor of computer science and engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re excited about this grant because it will give students research experience while they gain a deeper understanding of the barriers encountered by people with disabilities and the value of universal design, or designing for a wide range of bodies and abilities. With our ties to community resources, participants will receive important feedback about things that will improve lives,&#x201D; Rose said.</p>\n<p>Many times, assistive technology for people with disabilities is expensive and not actually helpful. Students in this program will gain an understanding of universal design and the need for more practical items that could be helpful in a learning environment, as well as in everyday life.</p>\n<p>For example, the sports wheelchairs used by wheelchair basketball teams like UTA&#x2019;s national champion Movin&#x2019; Mavs and Lady Movin&#x2019; Mavs cost between $3,000 and $5,000. That cost prevents most school districts from offering a wheelchair sport to their students with disabilities, but if assistive technologies could provide a less-expensive alternative, those students would be more likely to be able to play adapted sports. Another example is an exoskeleton intended to help a person with a spinal cord injury walk, but at a cost far beyond that feasible for most people.</p>\n<p>The grant will bring eight students per year to UTA&#x2019;s campus for a 10-week summer session in which they will learn research skills and basic disability studies concepts and work on assistive technologies. Two of those students will come from UTA, and the program will emphasize traditionally underrepresented populations, such as women, people of color and those with disabilities.</p>\n<p>The students will pick research projects in areas such as converting American Sign Language to speech, human-machine interactions, and making digital humanities accessible via the <a href=\"http://library.uta.edu/txdisabilityhistory/\">Texas Disability History Collection</a> at the UTA Libraries. They will learn how to perform research and gain context about people with disabilities, partly from people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>UTA is one of the nation&#x2019;s leading institutions in helping students with disabilities gain access to educational opportunities. The University was home to one of the country&#x2019;s first organizations for students with disabilities and was the first university in the United States to offer full scholarships for athletes in adapted sports.</p>\n<p>Rose directs UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://disabilitystudies.uta.edu/\">disability studies minor</a>, the first such program in the south and one of only about 30 in the nation. Rose currently is advising institutions such as Yale University and UT Austin as they consider establishing similar programs. Currently, 70 students from more than 20 departments and majors are completing the minor.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Cawthon, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Liberal Arts, said, &#x201C;This grant will enable us to further strengthen our work with and research in assistive technologies and disability studies. The knowledge gained through this collaborative effort will benefit not only the faculty, but the students and people with disabilities as well. With greater interaction and communication about peoples&apos; needs and how technology can respond to those needs, UTA will cement its status as a national leader in this area.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Research in the colleges of engineering and liberal arts related to assistive technologies and artificial intelligence include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fillia Makedon, professor of computer science and engineering, and Athitsos are developing iWork, a smart, robot-based system that assesses workers&#x2019; physical, cognitive and collaborative skills while they perform simulated manufacturing tasks with an emphasis on finding the best ways to train and prepare workers, both with and without disabilities, for the industry of the future, where a worker has to safely and efficiently collaborate with advanced robots.</li>\n<li>The pair also is working with Yale University to use artificial intelligence to help experts assess learning difficulties such as ADHD in children very early in their lives.</li>\n<li>Previously, Athitsos earned a National Science Foundation Early Career Grant to further develop a computer recognition system that will become a visual dictionary for American Sign Language.</li>\n<li>Greer has used her experience and research to help scientists and engineers better understand the human experience so that they can build more responsive robots.

This year&#x2019;s event is Sept. 13 at the Marriott Marquis.</p>\n<p>The Medallion of Excellence awards are presented to exemplary individuals who are role models and outstanding civic citizens for the Latino community, and Latino youth in particular.</p>\n<p>The award winners must have at least a 15-year record of contributions and accomplishments in their field with solid leadership and community involvement. The qualifying factor is philanthropic and civic engagement through the initiation or support of programs that benefit the Hispanic community as a whole.</p>\n<p>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said that Michele Bobadilla has inspired hundreds of students and enabled their success in college and careers through her work and advocacy.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;She is the voice for first- and second-generation students as well as those from underprivileged and economically disadvantaged populations, ensuring that they are not only provided every opportunity to avail of the benefits of higher education but that their path is guided by her personally,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;She is an icon in the field, setting the bar high and reminding us every day of the immense responsibility that we have as leaders in higher education and of the power of a helping hand in changing lives.&#xA0;I&#x2019;m immensely proud of the work that she does on behalf of The University of Texas at Arlington and am privileged to count on her as a member of our team, and as a friend.&#xA0;She has dedicated her life to the service of others and I&#x2019;m thrilled that she is being honored by the CHCI Medallion of Excellence award.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mateo Magdaleno, chief&#xA0;executive&#xA0;education&#xA0;officer of IDQ Group Inc., nominated Bobadilla for the honor.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Michele is a stalwart among leaders across the Nation,&#x201D; Magdaleno said. &#x201C;She has dedicated her life to combat poverty through education and her integrity in excellence has demonstrated her place among those historically honored for this award.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Arcilia Acosta, CEO of CARCON Industries &amp; Construction and STL Engineers, and a board member of the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, has long known of Bobadilla&#x2019;s value, to not only Hispanics, but to the universities, community colleges and school districts that serve thousands of students.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This prestigious award is a true testament to Michele&apos;s hard work, fearless spirit and lifelong commitment to education,&#x201D; Acosta said. &#x201C;There is no doubt that Michele understands the vision for the future of higher education. Her dedication over the years has changed the lives of many young people by encouraging and helping them to enter college and go on to lead successful lives for themselves and their families.

That is why encouraging students&#x2019; interest in studying mathematics through programs such as SURGE is so important.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Principal investigator of the grant is Tuncay Aktosun, professor of mathematics and SURGE program director. Co-principal investigators and SURGE faculty members include Associate Professor Ruth Gornet, Professor Hristo Kojouharov, Associate Professor Barbara Shipman, and Su.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Aktosun and the PI team have done a tremendous job in mentoring undergraduate math students for the last 10 years through the SURGE program,&#x201D; Su said. &#x201C;We have an outstanding record in assisting our students in getting bachelor degrees in mathematics, especially students from historically underrepresented groups, including females and underrepresented minorities.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The project also will foster collaboration between UTA and two large community college systems in North Texas: the Dallas County Community College District and Tarrant County College. The UTA Department of Mathematics will host regular activities for DCCCD and TCC students and mathematics professors through the SURGE program.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The SURGE program is a superb example of an initiative that is directly addressing the urgent need for highly talented STEM graduates, mathematics in particular,&#x201D; said Morteza Khaledi., dean of the College of Science. &#x201C;This new grant from NSF reflects well the UTA Mathematics Department as a national leader in teaching and mentoring of undergraduate math majors.&#x201D;&#xA0; &#xA0;</p>\n<p>The SURGE project will build on an existing mathematics learning community at UTA, anchored by the local student chapter of the Mathematical Association of America. In addition to close interactions with their faculty, peer and industry mentors, SURGE students will have opportunities to take on leadership roles in the local MAA chapter, enable peer mentorship among all mathematics majors and work on outreach and other community services.</p>\n<p>The program also pairs SURGE students who are interested in continuing on to graduate studies with graduate student mentors. They&#x2019;re encouraged to participate in faculty research projects and research experiences for undergraduates programs at UTA or other universities. The grant also sends them to conferences to interact with other mathematicians. These activities give students an early exposure to graduate studies and research, builds their confidence in pursuing advanced study and doing research, and establishes connections with research mathematicians outside of UTA.</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><i>-Written by Greg Pederson</i></p>\n"

An average book that contains hundreds of pages may be composed of various conditions of preservation and faded writing.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We come up against additional challenges such as poor internet connections that require that we work with hard drives as storage and physically transport the digitized documentation,&#x201D; LaFevor said. &#x201C;Navigating the multiple interests associated with this work can also be complex.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Cuba&#x2019;s Catholic Church has played a major role in the preservation project, granting access to church archives and helping to identify important documents.</p>\n<p>Spanish colonial rulers recognized the &#x201C;personhood&#x201D; of slaves once they were baptized into the Catholic Church, which is why births, marriages, geographic origins and deaths were recorded in church archives.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The reality is that this work could potentially last my lifetime,&#x201D; LaFevor said. &#x201C;There are millions of documents which form a hugely important legacy as historical documentation of Afro-Cuban cultures and experience. Our aim is to save as many as possible.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>LaFevor is also showcasing a new photographic exhibit,&#xA0;<i>Cuba: Histories of the Present</i>, through Aug. 3 in gallery space at Artes de la Rosa, 1140 N.

He had a hand in assembling five recruiting classes that ranked nationally inside ESPN&apos;s Top 10.</p>\n<p>Ogden has coached seven players who have gone onto have their name called in the NBA Draft, six of which were selected in the first round (Thompson, No. 4 by Cleveland in 2011; Jordan Hamilton, No. 26 by Dallas in 2011; Joseph, No. 29 by San Antonio in 2011; Avery Bradley, No. 19 by Boston in 2010; Damion James, No. 24 by Atlanta in 2010; and Turner, No. 11 by Indiana in 2015).</p>\n<p>Ogden played four seasons at forward for the Longhorns from 2000-03 and was a member of four NCAA Tournament teams. The Longhorns reached the 2003 NCAA Final Four with Ogden serving as a senior captain. He finished his Texas career with 97 team victories, more than any other player in program history at the time.</p>\n<p>Ogden played in 85 career games which included three starts. He totaled 144 points, 88 rebounds and 40 assists. Ogden earned the team&apos;s Jay Arnette Award as a junior in 2001-02. The honor is given to a player for behind-the-scenes efforts and contributions to the team.</p>\n<p>Following his collegiate playing career, Ogden joined the Texas basketball staff as a student assistant coach for the 2003-04 season while he completed his undergraduate degree. He earned his Bachelor of Science in education in 2004.</p>\n<p>Ogden, a native of Seminole, Texas, played four years of varsity basketball at Seminole High School. He was crowned the state of Texas&apos; &quot;Mr. Basketball&quot; following his senior season in 1998-99.

The innovative transistors could yield huge energy savings dollars to companies like Google, Yahoo! or Amazon that need large amounts of transistor operations in their data centers.</p>\n<p>Seong Jin Koh, a Department of Materials Science and Engineering professor and the principal architect behind the research, said the technology evolves now to enable large-scale, manufacturable, marketable devices.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This novel transistor reduces power consumption, runs the devices cooler and allows smaller battery packs to operate the component,&#x201D; Koh said.</p>\n<p>The new technology would be invaluable since a computer or cell phone user wouldn&#x2019;t have to charge their device every few hours.</p>\n<p>Instead cell phone users might only have to charge their devices once every couple of weeks, Koh said.</p>\n<p>In addition to commercial applications, there are many military uses for the technology. Batteries weigh a lot, and less power consumption means reducing the battery weight of electronic equipment that soldiers are carrying. That would enhance soldiers&#x2019; combat capabilities.</p>\n<p>Other potential military applications include electronics for remote sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles and high-capacity computing in remote operations.</p>\n<p>Teri Schultz, director of technology management in the UTA Office of Research, said the technology has great potential to make it to the marketplace.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;When you&#x2019;re talking about cost-saving solutions to companies as big as Google or Amazon, that speaks to the practical nature of this research,&#x201D; Schultz said. &#x201C;That all trickles down to the consumer, whether it&#x2019;s someone who has a more efficient cell phone or someone using one of those large businesses.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The research also resulted in an academic paper published in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5745\">Nature Communications</a> in 2014 about cooling electrons using quantum wells. In that paper, Koh discovered a way to cool electrons to -228 degrees Celsius without external means. The process involved passing electrons through a quantum well to cool them and keep them from heating. This is the second patent issued from this family with the first issued in July 2017.</p>\n<p>Funding supporting this research is from the National Science Foundation and Office of Naval Research.</p>\n<p>In addition to Koh, team members on this research include Kishan Jayanand and Lei Wu, graduate students in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering.</p>\n<p>Pradeep Bhadrachalam and Liang-Chieh Ma, two UTA graduates, are the other two inventors on the patent.</p>\n"

An equal percentage reported that art therapy helped them cope with everyday life.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Texas has one of the highest populations of veterans in the U.S. and very little accredited art therapy support,&#x201D; said Amanda Alexander, UTA associate professor of Art Education and leader of the UTA program. &#x201C;We decided to develop art therapy workshops and measure symptom relief and healing for men and women dealing with service-related trauma or disabilities.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Alexander received an initial seed grant from the College of Liberal Arts to start the Artopia program and research its effectiveness among veterans at UTA. Five workshops and an art exhibition were developed in 2016 and 2017.</p>\n<p>The multidisciplinary project was guided by Alexander from the Art + Art History Department and faculty from the Department of Psychology in collaboration with the Veterans Assistance Center at UTA. Licensed art therapists from The Art Station, a Fort Worth nonprofit art therapy organization, provided the professional art therapy support.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/artopia-2.png\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Jane Avila, founder of The Art Station, explained that her organization aims to &#x201C;find a holistic way of helping veterans to bridge the gap from deployment to civilian life. Art therapy has been shown to reduce cortisol or stress hormone in the body within half an hour, and professionals like ourselves who also have mental health qualifications alongside knowledge of art can enhance that experience.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Before and after each workshop, researchers conducted a Profile of Mood States (POMS) survey with the veterans to measure psychological distress. The POMS survey is considered an excellent measure and is known for its ease of administration. More than 50 veterans attended the workshops and 33 completed the pre/post POMS survey.</p>\n<p>The results were overwhelmingly positive:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>98 percent said Artopia helped them cope with their service-related trauma</li>\n<li>98 percent reported that Artopia helped them cope with everyday life</li>\n<li>97 percent believe that Artopia helped them cope with their loved one&#x2019;s service-related trauma or disability</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x201C;With these initial positive results, we are now looking to gain more funding for a larger project with more veterans,&#x201D; Alexander said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/artopia-3.png\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Other positive impacts include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The veterans reported that their overall mood disturbance was at least 50 percent lower after participating in Artopia workshops</li>\n<li>98 percent of the veterans enjoyed working with the art therapists</li>\n<li>98 percent of the veterans found the Artopia workshops helpful</li>\n<li>97 percent of the veterans believed that the Artopia workshops were educational</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Elisabeth Cawthon, UTA&#x2019;s Dean of Liberal Arts, underlined the importance of this project to UTA, one of the country&#x2019;s leading institutions for veterans.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Military Times has ranked UTA the no.1 university in Texas for veterans and their families to earn a college degree, and this research really forms part of the services that we can provide to that constituency,&#x201D; Cawthon said. &#x201C;The project is also a great example of multidisciplinary work of the College of Liberal Arts with the College of Science and the Veterans Assistance Center around the University&#x2019;s Strategic Theme of Health and the Human Condition and effectively allows for new ideas through cross-collaborative work.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

The three-year, $251,000 grant relates to another grant that he received in March to develop a new microscope that can capture 3-D motion, then add time to construct a 4-D beating heart using optical imaging techniques with fluorescent nanoparticles in a zebrafish.</p>\n<p>As the ventricular chambers of the heart develop, mechanical forces such as contraction of the heart muscle and blood flow cause ridges and grooves to form in a wavelike pattern called a trabecular network in the direction of the blood flow. Too much or too little trabeculation can lead to defects with high mortality rates.</p>\n<p>Lee will use the new grant to explore targeted delivery of messenger RNA, or mRNA, to reverse damage caused by congenital heart disease by modulating the mechanical forces to reduce gene expressions. Then, he will use nanoparticles to encapsulate the mRNA and deliver it to the heart. Once the mRNA is introduced, he will recover the gene expression to see if trabeculation occurs even in the absence of mechanical forces.</p>\n<p>Messenger RNA conveys genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where they specify the amino acid sequence of the protein products of gene expression.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Without mechanical forces, gene expression goes away. We are trying to find a way to stimulate gene expression even in the absence of those mechanical forces,&#x201D; Lee said. &#x201C;We can&#x2019;t control biomechanical forces, such as whether a patient has low contractility or low blood flow, but if we can control the gene expression that leads to cardiac development we could eventually repair congenital heart defects and other damage to the heart.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Part of the research will include using the microscope that he developed to integrate multi-view fusion to enhance the quality of the image. Multi-view fusion involves taking photos around an object 45 degrees apart, then using a computer to fuse the photos together to increase quality by eliminating dark areas of the photos affected by the scattering of light in the object.</p>\n<p>Lee&#x2019;s work is the latest example of UTA&#x2019;s research in cardiac health in support of health and the human condition, a key tenet of the University&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Michael Cho, professor and Alfred R. and Janet H. Potvin Endowed Chair of the Bioengineering Department.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I am delighted that Dr. Lee has received this prestigious grant so early in his career. His achievements in his first year as an assistant professor are outstanding,&#x201D; Cho said. &#x201C;This new grant, coupled with his current grant, will provide critical insight into how gene expressions can be used to jump-start heart growth or healing. Promising discoveries could lead to major advances in how heart defects and damage from congenital heart disease are treated.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Other recent examples of UTA research in cardiac health include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Nelson, assistant professor of kinesiology, is using a $3.3 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the link between fat storage in the heart and cardiovascular disease, as well as the influence of gender on the development of cardiac dysfunction.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Bioengineering Professor Kytai Nguyen earned a National Institutes of Health T-32 grant totaling more than $1 million over five years to recruit and train outstanding doctoral students in nanotechnology and nanomedicine related to cardiovascular and pulmonary issues.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Mark Haykowsky, a cardiovascular exercise scientist in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, received a $308,000 grant from the National Institutes of Health to study exercise intolerance in older heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Yi Hong, an assistant professor in the Bioengineering Department, was awarded a $211,000 R21 grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop materials that will allow doctors to use a 3-D printer to create unique new blood vessels for children with vascular defects.</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>&#xA0;-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>\n"
