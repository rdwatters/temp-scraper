The 10-inch long specimen was preserved in a museum collection. Amazingly, a live specimen has never been found in the ensuing 42 years.</p><p>&#x201C;This small snake was obtained now over 40 years ago, and the report of its discovery has been a long time in coming,&#x201D; the co-authors wrote in the&#xA0;<i>Journal of Herpetology</i>&#xA0;paper. &#x201C;We were optimistic that additional specimens might be secured, but after at least a dozen more trips into the region spanning several decades, we have been unrewarded.&#x201D;</p><p><i>Cenaspis</i>&#xA0;has several unique features that defy placing it in any known genus and clearly distinguishes it from all known genera. These include undivided subcaudal scales, or enlarged plates on the underside of its tail; a lack of spines and presence of cup-like structures called calyces on its hemipenes, or paired male reproductive organs found in snakes and lizards; and the shape of its skull.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt=\"A new species of snake\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/cenaspis-snake.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>UTA researchers found a new species of snake.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>The first two of those features are not found in any other known snake in the family&#xA0;<i>Colubridae</i>&#xA0;in the Western Hemisphere.&#xA0;<i>Colubridae</i>&#xA0;is the largest snake family and includes just over 51 percent of all known living snake species.</p><p>Utilizing the vast resources of UTA&#x2019;s Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center for comparative purposes, the researchers made CT scans of dozens of specimens of snakes. The biologists believe that due to some of the specimen&#x2019;s physical features,&#xA0;<i>Cenaspis</i>&#xA0;is likely a burrowing snake that feeds on insects and spiders. Campbell believes that&#xA0;<i>Cenaspis</i>&#xA0;is not extinct but has eluded capture due to its burrowing lifestyle and other elusive habits.</p><p>&#x201C;This provides evidence of just how secretive some snakes can be,&#x201D; Campbell told&#xA0;<i>National Geographic</i>, which ran a story about the discovery in its Dec, 19, 2018, edition. &#x201C;Combine their elusive habits with restricted ranges and some snakes do not turn up often.&#x201D;</p><p>He noted said that because of the snake&#x2019;s unique nature, the Chiapas highlands area of southern Mexico where it was found all those years ago should be considered for protected status, so that more unknown species can be discovered and not face possible extinction.</p><p>Campbell is one of the world&#x2019;s pre-eminent herpetologists and has spent over 45 years discovering, studying and describing the herpetofauna of North, Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean and West Africa. He earned a doctorate in systematics and ecology from the University of Kansas in 1982 and came to UTA in 1983. He has overseen the tremendous growth of UTA&#x2019;s Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center from a modest collection into one of the top centers for herpetology in the world, with one of the largest collections of specimens anywhere. His work has described more than 100 new species, some of which were on the brink of becoming extinct without ever being known.</p><p>Smith came to UTA in 1992 for graduate school and has been here ever since. He earned an master&#x2019;s degree in biology in 1994 and a doctorate in quantitative biology in 2001, then worked as a postdoctoral associate and research associate before joining the Department of Biology faculty as an assistant professor in 2006. He has conducted extensive research of snake species in North and Central America and Indonesia, conducting frequent field and collection work and publishing dozens of journal articles. He also collaborates with other researchers on large-scale temporal and spatial biogeography and biodiversity studies.</p><p>Hall worked as a postdoctoral researcher at UTA in 2017 after receiving his doctorate, then accepted a position with Thermo Fisher Scientific, a biotechnology product development company, as a product application specialist. At UTA he won a prestigious National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant in 2015 and a UTA Office of Graduate Studies Dissertation Fellowship in 2016, among various other awards.</p><div style=\"text-align: right;\">-- written by Greg Pederson</div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>"

Rather, it disperses in different directions depending on the type of soil, temperature, pressure and other factors. Eventually, it rises to the surface, but it may not be anywhere near the leak and the levels of gas in the atmosphere where it comes out at another location are often not detectable with current instruments, even though large pockets of gas may still be trapped underground. This migration and difficulty in detection costs time in finding and repairing the leak. It also may lead to greater danger as the gas continues to build up.</p><p>Smits and her colleague, Dan Zimmerle of Colorado State University, created a pipeline test bed as part of the Methane Emissions and Technology Evaluation Center or METEC that allows them to control the pipeline leakage rate, subsurface conditions, moisture, surface conditions and other factors, and use sensors to monitor how gas moves underground and how it acts once it reaches the surface. Using the data collected, the team has created a data set that can predict how gas will act under specific subsurface and atmospheric conditions. Smits is now working to apply this modeling to create an algorithm that can be applied in the field by industry leak first responders.</p><p>&#x201C;Our research shows interesting results that go against the conventional wisdom that if there&#x2019;s a large leak you&#x2019;ll be able to see it or easily detect it aboveground. In fact, we have found that the concentrations of gas in the atmosphere are often very small in comparison to the size of the leak,&#x201D; Smits said.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt=\"pipeline testbed field site in Colorado\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/gas-pipeline-testbed-field-site-smits.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Smits is leading the project, which includes research at the pipeline testbed field site at the Methane Emissions Technology Evaluation Center in Fort Collins, Colo.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>&#x201C;The methods being used today to detect natural gas leaks from pipelines are flawed because most of the technologies are not sensitive enough, the methods aren&#x2019;t consistent enough, and there&#x2019;s a general denial that there&#x2019;s a problem. We&#x2019;re hoping that by providing data-based guidelines for industry first responders that allow them to take all of the environmental and geological factors into account at a potential leak site, leaks will be detected and repaired before they become a larger problem.&#x201D;</p><p>Once Smits completes her algorithm, she and her team will accompany first responders from five industry leaders to leak sites to test whether their modeling works and get the industry on board with the new guidelines.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s important for oil and gas companies to show that they&#x2019;re trying to get a handle on the problem. With so many pipelines and aging infrastructure, leaks are inevitable. Companies need to be able to reassure their customers and communities that they are able to detect and repair leaks effectively to ensure safety,&#x201D; Smits said.</p><p>Smits&#x2019; research is an example of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, said Ali Abolmaali, chair of the Civil Engineering Department.</p><p>&#x201C;Natural gas has led to several deadly explosions in the past few years that could have potentially been avoided if there was a better understanding of how gas acts when it leaks from a pipe and how to better detect it. Dr. Smits and her team have done excellent work in their research, and in getting cooperation from industry to apply their findings in a way that could save lives and property,&#x201D; Abolmaali said.</p><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>About Civil Engineering</b></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Civil Engineering Department enrollment exceeds 1,200 students.

Since the information is coming multiple sources, it can be difficult to make full sense of the data. For example, during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, emergency management personnel and officials at all levels of local, regional and state government found it difficult to digest all of the information consistently in real time to make decisions about evacuations and other life-or-death situations.</p><p>Seo will apply a Bayesian model to forecasting, which will allow him to add new information to what is already known to update knowledge, then combine the parts to provide the most accurate forecast. In this application, forecasts and metrics will be entered into a multi-model merging module, then put out as an integrated forecast, which will reduce forecast uncertainty. Emergency management officials will then have a greater understanding of how each forecast impacted the integrated forecast, which will allow greater confidence in the decisions they make going forward.</p><p>Seo&#x2019;s research in flood forecasting, the National Water Model and other water-related areas is an example of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, said Ali Abolmaali, chair of the Department of Civil Engineering.</p><p>&#x201C;Hurricanes and flooding cause a great deal of damage and endanger millions of people each year. The work Dr. Seo is doing will greatly enhance the ability of municipalities to make decisions based on in-depth information that will keep their citizens safe and lessen the impact of these storms on their communities,&#x201D; Abolmaali said.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>"

Our excellence is demonstrated by our newly graduated, online, Family Nurse Practitioner, students&#x2019; first time certification pass rate of 96 percent in 2017.&#x201D;</p><p>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said nursing continues to be one of the most sought-after degrees, both among students and among industry.</p><p>&#x201C;I am pleased to see national recognition of the excellence of our graduate programs in nursing,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;This is a reflection of the commitment of our faculty to ensuring that UTA plays a leading role in not just addressing the issue of nursing shortages in Texas but does this in a way that ensures the highest level of academic rigor and quality of instruction and training. Our nurses are highly sought after by hospitals and health care providers across the state and nation, and this ranking further emphasizes the tremendous efforts of our dedicated faculty and staff.</p><p>Larry Gomez, who earned his MSN online from UTA in December 2017, said he liked the program because of its convenience and the responsiveness of the professors. He said found the program challenging and that appealed to him as well.</p><p>&#x201C;I was a returning adult,&#x201D; said Gomez, an emergency room nurse practitioner who also works as an EMS supervisor for the Houston Fire Department. &#x201C;I had two jobs, a wife and three kids. I liked the convenience of being able to access the lectures and materials 24 hours a day. And the professors were great. They were so responsive to the needs of students. They were literarily a phone call, email or text away. They were quick to respond and very well organized.&#x201D;</p><p>Gomez liked the program so much that he&#x2019;s returning to UTA next month to pursue his doctor of nursing practice or DNP degree, a program that takes about two years to complete.</p><p>The College of Nursing and Health Innovation (CONHI) ranked No. 50 among master&#x2019;s of nursing programs in U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x2019;s 2019 Best Graduate Schools. It ranked No. 52 in the nation in its doctor of nursing practice programs, which is second best in the state.</p><p>Other accolades CONHI has achieved include:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>No. 1 in Texas and No. 9 in the nation for veteran friendliness as ranked by College Factual. The rankings look for colleges that produce quality outcomes in nursing and offer support and resources to help veterans and active-duty military students thrive.&#xA0;</li><li>CONHI is designated a Center of Excellence by the&#xA0;National League for Nursing for Enhancing Student Learning and Professional Development.</li><li>No. 7 on the&#xA0;Top 20 Online Nursing Degree Programs<b>&#xA0;</b>list by OnlineSchoolsCenter.com in 2019.</li></ul><p>&#xA0;</p>"

In a prolapse, the pelvic floor muscles weaken and tear, allowing the vagina to stretch or expand and protrude on surrounding organs and structures. Treatment usually involves surgical implantation of mesh to repair the muscles, but the mesh often leads to severe complications that require extended recovery time and cause discomfort.</p><p>Hong and his team are developing a strong, bioactive bioadhesive that is strong and bioactive to reattach the pelvic floor muscles early, before they detach completely, and stop further tearing while the body repairs the affected muscles.</p><p>&#x201C;A lot of women suffer from vaginal prolapse and it really affects their quality of life. Hopefully, our research will help women and ease their discomfort,&#x201D; Hong said.</p><p>&#x201C;It is difficult to repair a full muscle tear, but if a prolapse is detected early, we can glue the two edges together while they are still partially attached and prevent further damage. Because it is bioactive, the adhesive will allow the body to rejuvenate naturally, and there will be far less discomfort for the patient.&#x201D;</p><p>Hong&#x2019;s research is an example of health and the human condition, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, and of the ways that the University is making an impact on the community, said Michael Cho, chair of the Bioengineering Department.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a condition that affects women of all ages, and Dr. Hong and his team have a chance to make its treatment easier and less intrusive for those women. His ability to apply knowledge and techniques from previous research, as well as the strengths from the interdisciplinary team of investigators, will lead to success,&#x201D; Cho said.</p><p>The Bioengineering Department has served North Texas for more than 40 years, with research strengths in bioinstrumentation, biomaterials and tissue engineering, biomechanics, medical imaging and nanomedicine/nanotechnology. The program was ranked No. 96 in the 2019 U.S. News &amp; World Report graduate rankings. UTA offers a joint program with UT Southwestern, one of the top medical schools in the country, and students can take courses and conduct research at either campus.&#xA0;UTA researchers have labs in UTSW&#x2019;s Bill and Rita Clements Advanced Medical Imaging Building for work on medical imaging projects. An undergraduate program was added in 2012. In 2017, the department won a&#xA0;National Institutes of Health T-32 grant to subsidize and train doctoral students in healthcare applications for nanotechnology, specifically to develop tools to battle cardiovascular and pulmonary ailments.</p><p align=\"right\">--&#xA0;&#xA0;<i>Written by Jeremy Agor</i></p><p>&#xA0;</p><p>&#xA0;</p>"

Based on field research in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and northern and southern California, the study found that despite inconsistent resources and coordination problems, non-profits, religious groups, and businesses provided much-needed support and funding.</p><p>Daniel Sledge, the study&#x2019;s co-author and a UTA associate professor of political science, said: &#x201C;For me, the most important aspect of our findings was the massive variation across counties in terms of the ability of non-profits to respond to disasters. This was particularly striking in Puerto Rico, where many areas simply did not possess the non-profit and volunteer resources necessary to fill in gaps in what government was doing.&#x201D;</p><p>FEMA&#x2019;s National Response Framework assumes a crucial role for non-profits, religious groups, and businesses that are expected to fill in gaps in government&#x2019;s ability to respond. About 76 percent of non-profits surveyed for the study reported that had they not actively provided community services during and after the disaster, their services may not have been provided by someone else. Of those, only 16.9 percent believed the government might have stepped in and provided their services had the organizations not been active.</p><p>After surveying 115 non-profits engaged in disaster response and engaging in 44 hours of interviews, the study concluded that voluntary organizations active in disaster, or VOADs, are critical to successful post-disaster coordination and recovery. VOADs bring together voluntary groups and representatives from local and state government agencies to coordinate actions, share information and target their efforts during and after disasters.</p><p>The study found that these collaborative groups were most successful when they were already active before a disaster struck.</p><p>In Sonoma County, Calif., local groups began building a VOAD after the 2017 wildfires but because it wasn&#x2019;t active before the disaster, non-profits and other groups faced serious challenges in coordinating their responses to the fires.</p><p>However, in neighboring Napa County, voluntary groups reported strong coordination with each other and local government. As one non-profit representative said, &#x201C;the key difference here is that we had the [VOAD] in place and they [Sonoma] didn&#x2019;t.&#x201D; The county&#x2019;s VOAD group was launched prior to the wildfires and was funded by a donation from the local vintners&#x2019; trade association following a 2014 earthquake.</p><p>Herschel Thomas, the study&#x2019;s co-author and UTA assistant professor of political science, said: &#x201C;The big takeaway from our research is that these organizations need help. They are expected to do extraordinary things. By funding local Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters, the federal government can help to improve community capability to respond to disaster.&#x201D;</p><p>Scott Robinson, political science department chair at the University of Oklahoma, researches and is an expert in disaster politics, public and nonprofit management, and policy process theory.</p><p>&#x201C;Successful disaster and emergency response requires the participation of diverse organizations from public to private to nonprofit organizations - including some that don&apos;t think of themselves as an emergency response organizations.&#xA0;This research from Thomas and Sledge illustrates the often unrecognized contribution of nonprofit and religious organizations.&#x201D;</p><p>Elisabeth Cawthon, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Liberal Arts, said, &#x201C;Dr. Thomas and Dr. Sledge demonstrate a keen understanding of the reactions of community organizations and policy-makers to environmental disasters.&#xA0;Through their timely research via the NSF Rapid Response Grant, Dr. Sledge and Dr. Thomas showcase CoLA researchers&#x2019; skill in identifying problems and suggesting practical solutions.&#xA0;Dr. Sledge and Dr. Thomas are to be commended for their work as individual investigators, as well as their mentorship of several undergraduate and graduate students in this important project.&#x201D;</p>"

The data was derived from sources including <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>, the National Center for Education Statistics and PayScale.com.</p><p>&#x201C;We are extremely proud of our Master of Science in Human Resource Management (MSHRM) program,&#x201D; said Harry Dombroski, who was hired April 30 as UTA&#x2019;s dean for the College of Business. &#x201C;Our MSHRM program has historically been a very high-quality program that was designed to meet all the guidelines of the Society for Human Resource Management for quality master&#x2019;s programs in HR, and it richly deserves its No. 5 ranking by CollegeChoice.net.&#x201D;</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the demand for human resources managers is expected to grow by 9 percent through 2026.</p><p>UTA&#x2019;s master in human resources degree program ranked behind only the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Texas A&amp;M University, Wisconsin University and Villanova University. UTA finished ahead of such notable schools as Purdue, Cornell, Marquette and Vanderbilt.</p><p>Among the top 25 schools, UTA is the most affordable option, as it is the only university with an annual tuition of less than $21,000, at $16,980, according to College Choice. Furthermore, 14 of the top 25 schools have an annual tuition of more than double that of UTA.</p><p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s program provides great value for a high-quality education,&#x201D; Dombroski said, &#x201C;which is reflective of the goal of UTA&#x2019;s College of Business&#x2014;namely, to align ourselves with the needs of our core constituencies by delivering high-quality, innovative and distinctive educational programs at a cost that allows our students to achieve their professional goals without incurring unmanageable amounts of student debt.&#x201D;</p><p>College Choice noted that UTA&#x2019;s master in human resource management program combines general business knowledge with a concentration in HR management. The curriculum involves 18 hours of required work in human resource management, with six hours focused on research and statistical methods for decision-making and problem-solving. Students can choose between a thesis (30 credits) and non-thesis plan of study (36 credits).</p><p>Full-time students can graduate in two years and study HR analytics, talent management, total rewards, employment law, and HR consulting with a focus on applied skills.&#xA0; Graduates of the UTA MSHRM work at all the largest employers in DFW, several local governments, and non-profit organizations.&#xA0; Students have interned with such companies as Lockheed Martin, Texas Instruments and Bell Helicopter.</p><p>Dombroski noted that he&#x2019;s &#x201C;very proud of the work&#x201D; that George S. Benson has done in growing the program. Benson is the chair of UTA&#x2019;s Department of Management and was director of the program from 2010 to 2018.&#xA0; Benson said UTA revised the curriculum in 2010 for the MSHRM program, emphasizing the added elements of analytics and quantitative decision-making in all the classes. He noted that UTA was one of the first universities to have a class in HR metrics and analytics. UTA also added an applied consulting class.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re very proud of our program that&#x2019;s in the company of some very distinguished universities,&#x201D; said Benson, who has been at UTA since 2002.&#xA0; &#x201C;We&#x2019;re also one of the more affordable programs. We&#x2019;ve worked hard to make sure that the curriculum is cutting-edge. We have a great set of scholar-practitioner faculty who bring a balance of academic and industry experience. We have an excellent group of students. We have industry partners who serve on our advisory board who have given us a lot of input on our curriculum to help make our students employable.&#x201D;</p><p>Additionally, Human Resources MBA recently recognized UTA&#x2019;s master in human resources program. The agency placed UTA No. 6 in its 2019 list of the &#x201C;20 Best Master&#x2019;s in Human Resources.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;HR as a field is growing in importance for companies to be able to compete for talent and manage organizational culture,&#x201D; Benson said. &#x201C;There are a lot of opportunities for students, and we feel like we&#x2019;re meeting their needs. We&#x2019;re still working on ways still to get better and improve. We would like to grow the program. We would like to generate more opportunities for our students with national employers coming in to recruit on campus.</p><p>&#x201C;Our students are hungry for opportunities and hopefully these rankings will get the word out that people need to come to UTA to find HR talent.&#x201D;</p><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Brandon George</em></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>"

This effort is in collaboration with Professor Alper Atamturk from the University of California-Berkeley and Professor Ross Baldick from University of Texas at Austin. Their team is one of the only 18 teams, and the only one from Texas, to receive $250,000 in funding for the competition, which is open to any qualified competitor, not just those who are funded.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a departure from traditional routes to research funding which is motivated by other success&#xA0;stories such as the DARPA Prize Challenges,&#x201D; Madani said. &#x201C;The competition highlights the importance of computational sciences in&#xA0;energy efficiency and&#xA0;sustainability, so the advancements made in the framework of the competition could have lasting benefits and encourage people from other disciplines to work on energy-related problems.&#x201D;</p><p>The competition is a series of challenges aimed at hastening the development and evaluation of software solutions for the future of the electric grid, including optimal use of current and emerging technologies, management of dynamic grid operations and management of emerging distributed energy resources such as wind turbines, biomass generators and rooftop solar units.</p><p>The first challenge is to develop solutions to the electric power sector&apos;s security-constrained optimal power flow problem, which entails determining what generator settings that best enable power to be routed reliably and efficiently to customers across a complex grid reliably and efficiently. Teams will create algorithms that will be tested on complex, realistic power system models and will be scored on how well their algorithm performs relative to other teams&#x2019; algorithms.</p><p>Atamturk, a professor in UC Berkeley&#x2019;s Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, is an expert in optimization theory with real-world applications in power systems. Baldick is with UT Austin&#x2019;s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and holder of the Leland Barclay Fellow in Engineering. His research interests include optimization for energy systems. Madani will work with both to develop and implement algorithms for the GO competition.</p><p>Madani&#x2019;s participation in the competition highlights UTA&#x2019;s leadership in energy research and is an example of data-driven discovery and sustainable urban communities, two themes of the University&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, said Duane Dimos, vice president for research.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Madani and his colleagues have set themselves apart among grid optimization experts by earning funding to participate in the Grid Optimization Competition. UTA prizes innovative, transformative research, and the long-term potential of discoveries that come out of this competition is very exciting,&#x201D; Dimos said.</p><p>Other teams in the competition include representatives from Argonne, Lawrence Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, Georgia Tech, UC Berkeley, Pennsylvania State University and several private-sector companies.</p><p>ARPA-E advances high-potential, high-impact energy technologies that are too early for private-sector investment. Projects funded by ARPA-E have the potential to greatly impact U.S. economic prosperity, national security, and environmental well-being.</p><p>UTA&#x2019;s Department of Electrical Engineering provides student opportunities to broaden and intensify knowledge in a number of areas of electrical engineering. The program was ranked No. 85 in U.S. News and World Report&#x2019;s 2019 graduate rankings.

A femtosecond is one quadrillionth, or one millionth of a billionth, of a second.</p><p>Maddalena previously earned a $1.01 million DURIP grant to support the design and construction of the new wind tunnel.</p><p>&#x201C;Our research is making a critical contribution to the development of key technologies for hypersonic vehicles. These grants show that the Aerodynamics Research Center is at the cutting edge of research in this area and our long-term vision is being rewarded, first through our world-class facility and now with this additional funding to make the facility even more exclusive in its capabilities,&#x201D; Maddalena said.</p><p>When hypersonic vehicles cruise through the atmosphere at 3,500 miles per hour or faster, friction causes them to heat up to more than 8,000 degrees Kelvin, or about 15,000 degrees Fahrenheit. At these temperatures, air also undergoes chemical reactions and nitrogen and oxygen molecules start to dissociate and form a reacting mixture of atomic oxygen and nitrogen, plus regular molecular oxygen and nitrogen. This superheated air, or plasma, flows around the vehicle and evolves as it does so, making it necessary for engineers to calculate simultaneously its chemistry and fluid dynamics to develop an effective heat shield.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption400\"><img alt=\"UTA wind tunnel diagram\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/maddalena-wind-tunnel-diagram.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>UTA wind tunnel diagram</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Current models are not able to accurately predict what will happen in every situation, so Maddalena and his team will use the fundamental research grant to develop diagnostic techniques to characterize the plasma flow, thereby improving the understanding of the relationship between arc-jet test and flight environments.</p><p>&#x201C;It generally takes about 10 years to develop a new heat shield for a hypersonic vehicle and part of it is due to the uncertainties associated with the arc-jet plasma flow,&#x201D; Maddalena said. &#x201C;In other words, you don&#x2019;t know at what exact conditions you&#x2019;re testing.&#x201D;</p><p>For the Navy&#x2019;s specific applications, air density and skin friction on the hypersonic vehicle come into play, which can drastically change the performance of the thermal protection system. According to Maddalena, UTA is the only U.S. university with the ability to reproduce significant skin friction on the test articles with its facility.</p><p>Since the flow in the wind tunnel will be heated beyond temperatures at which any type of physical measurement device placed in it would survive, the femtosecond laser system will allow Maddalena and his team to non-intrusively measure the temperature and composition of the plasma flow. The laser system is so advanced that it has never been used in an arc-jet facility and will take six months to build.</p><p>The wind tunnel is housed in UTA&#x2019;s Aerodynamics Research Center, which boasts low-speed, transonic and supersonic wind tunnels and a hypersonic shock tunnel in addition to the arc-jet tunnel.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Maddalena continues to make a name for himself and for UTA, thanks to state-of-the-art diagnostics capabilities and the outlook for seminal contributions to fundamental research in hypersonics,&#x201D; said Erian Armanios, chair of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.</p><p>Maddalena&#x2019;s research continues UTA&#x2019;s long history of leadership in aerodynamics and is an example of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020</a>, said UTA Engineering Dean Peter Crouch.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a tremendous opportunity to highlight excellence and national leadership in hypersonics.&#xA0;Dr. Maddalena&#x2019;s research is at the cutting edge of our developing fundamental understanding that is critical to U.S. leadership in the field.&#xA0;It&#x2019;s wonderful to see his research being acknowledged nationally and internationally as integral to meeting these challenges,&#x201D; Crouch said.</p><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>"

It affects more than 200 million people worldwide, mostly in tropical and subtropical areas and especially in poor communities without access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation.</p><p>Epidemiologists in China and other countries have been studying schistosomiasis and attempting to eliminate it for more than a decade. They have been able to achieve eradication rates of 99 percent in some areas, but the disease has resisted being wiped out entirely.</p><p>&#x201C;We want to find out what it is about this disease that allows it to persist even in the face of aggressive control measures,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s important to get rid of schistosomiasis, but the scope of the project is much larger than learning how to eliminate this disease in any one area of the world.</p><p>&#x201C;The real importance of the study is in learning why we can&#x2019;t totally eliminate this parasitic disease, and then using that knowledge to help guide eradication campaigns for this and other parasitic diseases elsewhere. There&#x2019;s something about transmission patterns that perpetuate this disease that we don&#x2019;t understand yet. We want to know what&#x2019;s unique about the biology of this and other parasitic diseases in the end-game, when control has been fairly effective at reducing the disease but eradication cannot be achieved.&#x201D;</p><p>Castoe is working on the project with principal investigator Elizabeth Carlton and co-investigator David Pollock, both from the University of Colorado School of Medicine. Castoe spent five years as a postdoctoral fellow in Pollock&#x2019;s lab prior to coming to UTA in 2012.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Carlton contacted Dr. Pollock for help on the project, and he got in touch with me because the research I&#x2019;ve been doing to generate genome data from many individual samples complemented their goals well,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;Using genomic sequencing, this project will provide unprecedented insight into the detailed patterns of transmission across hosts, across geographic areas and through time. This will help us to understand how to prevent infections and advance efforts to achieve permanent reductions in schistosomiasis and other human helminthiases [worm infections].&#x201D;</p><p>The parasites that cause schistosomiasis live a portion of their life in certain types of freshwater snails. The infectious form of the parasite, known as cercariae, emerges from the snail into the water, which then infects people during routine agricultural, occupational and recreational activities. Lack of proper hygiene and activities of school-aged children such as swimming or fishing in infested water make them especially vulnerable to infection.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Illustration of aims of the research program\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/castoe-nih-project-2019.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Hypothesized sources of new schistomiasis infections in residual transmission hotspots to be investigated by the specific aims of the research program.

He is on the cutting edge of the field and one of the things that is so great about having him on the team is that he is always thinking about how we might leverage the latest advances in genomic sequencing to answer our research questions efficiently and effectively.&#x201D;</p><p>Carlton explained that the researchers are using new genomic sequencing technologies to map the ancestry of parasites, in an effort to identify human or animal hosts that may be acting as sources of new infection. They are following human and animal populations over time, testing them for infection and measuring risk factors.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re looking at new areas of infection, hotspots where we can&#x2019;t eliminate it,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;Many of the things we learn in this project could apply globally, to various parasitic diseases in many low- and middle-income countries. That&#x2019;s the goal.&#x201D;</p><p>College of Science Dean Morteza Khaledi praised the work that Castoe and his colleagues are doing and said it has the potential to have a far-reaching impact on health and the human condition, one of the main pillars of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Castoe is a leader in the field of genome sequencing and this project will benefit greatly from his expertise in this area,&#x201D; Khaledi said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s possible that the work he and his colleagues are doing in this study could be applied worldwide and be of tremendous benefit in the fight against parasitic diseases.&#x201D;</p><p>Castoe also has two other major federally funded projects underway, both involving genomic studies of snakes but seeking to answer fundamentally different questions.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Todd Castoe lab\" id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/castoe-lab.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Members of Todd Castoe&apos;s lab</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p><b>NSF project to understand the roles of selection and gene flow in speciation in rattlesnakes</b></p><p>The first of these projects, titled &#x201C;Systematics, introgression and adaptation in Western Rattlesnakes: A model system for studying gene flow, selection and speciation,&#x201D; is funded by a four-year, $867,402 grant from the National Science Foundation&#x2019;s Division of Environmental Biology. Castoe is principal investigator; co-PIs are Matthew Fujita, UTA associate professor of biology; Stephen Mackessy, professor in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Northern Colorado; and Jesse Meik, assistant professor of biological sciences at Tarleton State University, who earned a Ph.D. in Quantitative Biology from UTA in 2009.</p><p>The research focuses on the Western Rattlesnake and its close relatives as a model system to study the fundamental process of species formation.</p><p>&#x201C;Despite substantial research, the roles of natural selection in the formation of species and in preventing hybridization between species remain poorly understood,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;In a rapidly changing world, there is an urgent need to understand the importance of these processes in species formation and the impact of these processes on how scientists identify and name species.&#x201D;</p><p>The researchers will study genetic, venom protein and anatomical data to test how natural selection shapes and maintains species, then use the results to test several approaches for appropriately identifying species in nature.</p><p>&#x201C;Essentially, we&#x2019;re using rattlesnakes as a model to understand how some important features of speciation work in nature,&#x201D; Castoe said.</p><p>Previous studies have disagreed about how many species should be recognized within this group of snakes, and different populations can produce diverse symptoms from snake bites due to differences in venom biochemistry, the researchers explained. Their goals are to resolve these issues by developing a new system for understanding and appropriately recognizing species; providing new insight into the process of species formation; developing new methods for identifying species; and refining the appropriate medical treatment of snakebites in North America.</p><p>The project also includes a public outreach program, which will include educational tools and will be conducted at the Dallas and Denver Zoos, thereby reaching millions of visitors per year.</p><p><b>NSF project on regulation of intestinal form, function, and regeneration</b></p><p>The second project, titled &#x201C;Collaborative Research: Integrated mechanisms underlying the regulation of intestinal form and function,&#x201D; is funded by a four-year, $1.2 million grant from the NSF&#x2019;s Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.</p><p>Castoe is principal investigator and is joined in the study by co-principal investigator Saiful Chowdhury, UTA associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and Stephen Secor, professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, who is leading concurrent research.</p><p>Vertebrates exhibit a broad range of physiological capacities to alter intestinal performance that are adaptively linked to their feeding habits. This project&#x2019;s goal is to understand how and why some vertebrates&#x2014;including snakes that sometimes go long periods between meals&#x2014;experience rapid changes in intestinal form and function when feeding, and subsequent intestinal atrophy following the completion of digestion. This is in sharp contrast with snakes that feed more often and experience only modest change in intestinal form and function.</p><p>For the widely regulating Burmese python, for example, it is known that feeding triggers the differential expression of more than 1,000 intestinal genes. These snakes experience extreme regenerative intestinal growth with every major meal, and understanding how any vertebrate might accomplish such feats could be key to understanding how to direct regenerative growth in other vertebrates, like humans.</p><p>&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t know the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the structural and functional flexibility of the intestine, and whether such mechanisms are shared across vertebrates that similarly widely or narrowly regulate intestinal performance,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;By leveraging the extreme range in intestinal responses exhibited by snakes and other vertebrates and recently available genomic resources, this research program will identify the underlying mechanisms of intestinal flexibility and test if these mechanisms are shared or unique across lineages and regulatory phenotypes.</p><p>&#x201C;Ultimately, studying other vertebrates that exhibit regenerative intestinal growth could lead to breakthroughs in learning how to control regeneration in human tissues.&#x201D;</p><p>The researchers are addressing these broad questions by pursuing three aims. First, they are seeking to identify the cellular and structural mechanisms that underlie the modulation of intestinal form and regeneration, and whether form strictly dictates the regulation of intestinal function. Second, they&#x2019;re trying to link transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms to phenotypic changes in intestinal structure and function. Third, they want to test whether shared or unique sets of molecular mechanisms drive similar phenotypic responses among vertebrates.</p><p>&#x201C;Studying gene expression alone does not provide the complete picture of the function of a system. The expression and modification of proteins play significant roles in cellular functions,&#x201D; Chowdhury said. &#x201C;We are extracting proteins from the intestinal tissues of snakes and sequencing them using mass spectrometry. Using the same mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we are also identifying the phosphate modification sites in proteins. Intestinal-tissue proteomics analysis, before and after feeding, is helping us to understand the protein interaction network and signaling cascades linked to intestinal regeneration in snakes.&#x201D;</p><p>Chowdhury believes this project is the first to combine genomics and proteomics information to understand the molecular mechanisms which drive major shifts in intestinal function in snakes.</p><p>&#x201C;Ultimately, this research will identify the signaling and structural mechanisms by which vertebrates modulate intestinal form and function, and identify pathways that all vertebrates appear to possess that may direct intestinal regeneration capacity,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;We want to understand how vertebrates control, at the molecular level, shifts in intestinal form and function, and test if the regenerative capacities seen in some extreme vertebrate examples, like snakes, could be translated to other vertebrates such as humans.&#x201D;</p><p>Together, the NSF projects take advantage of the huge advances made in genome sequencing technology to tackle questions about the processes that drive diversity in form and function in nature. A number of the potential findings of these basic research studies have broad ramifications for understanding human genomic diversity and human health.</p><p>&#x201C;With both of these NSF projects, we&#x2019;re using genomics to answer fundamental questions about biology,&#x201D; Castoe said.</p><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Greg Pederson</em></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>"

Athletes first have to qualify at state tournaments and then be selected from the field at national championships. Munoz said she has eight national championship titles since she started competing in 2013.</p><p>Munoz started taekwondo when she was 10. She began training in Fort Bragg, N.C., where her father, Joe, was stationed in the Army. Munoz first trained under legendary Grandmaster Myong Sok Namkung Mayes, who became the first female in the world to reach the highest black belt taekwondo level as a 9<sup>th</sup> degree Dan.</p><p>Munoz also credits the help of taekwondo coach Barbara Brand, a three-time world championship bronze medalist. She met Brand at the world championships in 2014 and started training with her not long afterward.</p><p>But Munoz&#x2019;s primary taekwondo coach in Texas has been her father. Joe Munoz spent 25 years in the Army before retiring. He&#x2019;s owned Texas Forge Taekwondo (<a href=\"http://www.texasforgetkd.com\">www.texasforgetkd.com</a>) since October 2015. Joe, his wife, Del, and both of his daughters &#x2013; Munoz and 15-year-old Zoie &#x2013; train in taekwondo. Joe said they are all black belts, certified referees and Level I coaches.</p><p>Joe said he first had his family start martial arts as a way to learn self-defense together.</p><p>&#x201C;And it turned into a passion for my daughter,&#x201D; Joe said of Munoz, a fourth-degree master black belt. &#x201C;My daughter outranks us all by one rank and she&#x2019;s about to possibly get promoted again this year.

In addition, two Texas Instruments employees will be technical advisers for Osmanson to give her more in-depth knowledge of where industry is headed and help her shape her study to best match industry interests.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a very competitive fellowship. It&#x2019;s humbling that they selected me. I&#x2019;m hoping to work in the microelectronics industry after I earn my degree, and I know that what I learn through this fellowship will be put to good use in my career,&#x201D; Osmanson said.</p><p>Osmanson is the first UTA student to earn an SRC fellowship. She has two research projects assigned to her through the fellowship. Both involve microelectronics packaging with a specific focus in electromigration, which is the migration of electrons through conductors that can cause electrical failures within components. An example of microelectronics packaging is the green plastic board onto which electronic parts are soldered in solid-state electronics such as cell phones.</p><p>The SRC supports university research into common current and future problems in microelectronics. SRC Fellows have to work on SRC-funded grants, be excellent academically, be U.S. citizens or be permanent residents.</p><p>&#x201C;A lot of leaders in the microelectronics industry are former SRC fellows, so this will have a major impact on Allison&#x2019;s future,&#x201D; said Choong-Un Kim, a professor of materials science and engineering and Osmanson&#x2019;s faculty adviser. &#x201C;In addition to the obvious financial benefits, this fellowship will help her better tune her research direction to what industry needs, and she will make valuable contacts with people at companies such as Texas Instruments, Intel, IBM and others.&#x201D;</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption250\"><img alt=\"Allison Osmanson\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/osmanson-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Allison Osmanson</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Osmanson&#x2019;s fellowship is an example of how UTA serves students by <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/aspirations/student.php\">transforming the student experience by enhancing access and ensuring success</a> and by <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/aspirations/research.php\">engaging in high-impact research and scholarship</a>, two guiding aspirations with the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/index.php\">Strategic Plan 2020</a>, said Stathis Meletis, chair of the Materials Science and Engineering Department.</p><p>&#x201C;I was very pleased to learn that Allison earned an SRC fellowship.

Researchers from the University of Colorado-Boulder and the U.S. Air Force Academy also are involved with the project.</p><p>Artisanal and small-scale gold mining is generally characterized by simple technologies and lower yields compared to large-scale industrial mining, but about 30 percent of all gold used worldwide comes from ASGM, or artisanal and small-scale gold mining, sources. This type of mining leads to deforestation and environmental contamination because mercury is used to process the ore.</p><p>Past efforts to change these practices have not been successful because engineers or environmentalists go into the communities and tell them what to change and how to do things better, which leads to resistance from people whose families have mined the same way for generations. In contrast, Smits&#x2019; team is working with residents and local universities to go to the communities, get to know the people and find out what they would like to fix and why some ideas will work when others won&#x2019;t.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re taking a knowledge-based approach and talking to people who know what the issues are because they live in these communities,&#x201D; Smits said. &#x201C;Students in Peru are doing a lot of the interviews because they&#x2019;re more in touch with the culture.

The equipment will be used to expand his recent research in damage detection for blast-related traumatic brain injuries. UTA mechanical engineering Associate Professor Kamesh Subbarao is the co-investigator on the project.</p><p>Adnan and Subbarao will use a life-size model of a head to simulate and understand the brain, which will be measured using a combined electroencephalography, or EEG, and electrocorticography, or ECoG, system.

He previously published research that determined that, under certain circumstances, the mechanical forces of a blast-like event could damage the perineuronal net located adjacent to the neurons, which could in turn damage of the neurons themselves.</p><p>He and his team simulated a shock wave-induced cavitation collapse within the perineuronal net, which is a specialized extracellular matrix that stabilizes synapses in the brain. The team focused on the damage in hyaluronan, which is the net&#x2019;s main structural component, and showed that the localized supersonic forces created by an asymmetrical bubble collapse may break the hyaluronan. This improved current knowledge and understanding of the connection between damage to the perineuronal net and neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p>The award to Adnan and Subbarao is the second DURIP grant awarded to UTA&#x2019;s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department in recent months.

Surendra Shah, Presidential Distinguished Professor of Advanced Construction Materials, recently joined the faculty, and is an internationally renowned expert in cement-based materials and a member of the National Academy of Engineering who will serve as the director of the new Center of Excellence in Advanced Construction &amp; Innovative Materials for Infrastructure.</p><p>Yazdani is a fellow of ASCE, SEI and the American Concrete Institute. He is well known for his research on bridge design, evaluation and rehabilitation; resilient and high-performing infrastructure; natural and man-made hazard mitigation; concrete properties; and engineering education.</p><p>U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x2019;s 2020 &#x201C;Best Graduate Schools&#x201D; list ranks the College of Engineering No. 82 in the nation and No. 89 for its civil engineering graduate program.</p><p>UTA&#x2019;s SEI chapter helps students gain skills that will enable them to more easily transfer from student life to a career, Quadir said. The chapter provides training for software that professional engineers use in their careers, invite speakers, organize community service opportunities and host networking and social events.</p><p>The chapter has about 50 members, who hosted outreach activities for high school students and applied their knowledge of structural engineering as they built homes for Habitat for Humanity. The members also participated in a joint event with the SEI Fort Worth professional chapter, where professional members shared their experiences with the students.</p><p>UTA&#x2019;s SEI chapter, also won the national award in 2017, stands out nationally against other top-ranked universities such as Georgia Tech, the University of Illinois and Virginia Tech because of the faculty-student interaction, Yazdani said.</p><p>&#x201C;Although our research program is robust, our faculty takes time to engage with students,&#x201D; Yazdani said. &#x201C;Our students are special. Because we have so many international graduate students, and because they have unique challenges, I try to work with the chapter to help make their transition to UTA easier. Members perform admirably, in spite of their academic and research commitments.&#x201D;</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>"

ROS help kill toxins in the body, but can also be damaging to cells if they reach a critical level.</p><p>TiO<sub>2</sub> enters cells and produces ROS, which are able to damage plasma membranes, mitochondria and DNA, causing cell death.</p><p>&#x201C;Cancer cells are characterized by a higher steady-state saturation of ROS than normal, healthy cells,&#x201D; Chen said. &#x201C;This new therapy allows us to exploit that by raising the saturation of ROS in cancer cells to a critical level that triggers cell death without pushing the normal cells to that same threshold.&#x201D;</p><p>The pilot study for this new treatment concept builds upon Chen&#x2019;s expertise in the use of <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2018/10/Wei-Chen-cancer-patent.php\">nanoparticles to combat cancer</a>.</p><p>Chen&#x2019;s collaborators hail from the Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences and Beihang University. The team conducted experiments that demonstrate the nanoparticles can significantly suppress the growth of osteosarcomas under microwave irradiation.</p><p>While TiO<sub>2</sub> and low-power microwave irradiation alone did not effectively kill cancer cells, the combination of the two proved successful in creating a toxic effect for the tumor cells. Microwave ablation therapy has already proven to be an effective treatment against bone cancer, obtaining better results than MDT. However, MDT has applications for combatting other types of cancer, not just the osteosarcomas used for this pilot case.</p><p>Using light to activate ROS&#x2014;as is seen in photodynamic therapy&#x2014;can be challenging for the treatment of tumors deeply located within the body; in contrast, microwaves lend the ability to create deeper penetration that propagates through all types of tissues and non-metallic materials.</p><p>&#x201C;This new discovery is exciting because it potentially creates new avenues for treating cancer patients without causing debilitating side effects,&#x201D; Chen said. &#x201C;This targeted, localized method allows us to keep healthy cells intact so patients are better equipped to battle the disease.&#x201D;</p><p>The results of the pilot study indicate MDT is a promising approach for cancer treatment even though the method is still being developed and its limitations explored. The research team has filed a patent for MDT. Next, they plan to turn their attention to understanding the physics and internal mechanisms behind the powerful combination of microwaves and TiO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Chen continues to build a research portfolio that holds transformative implications for cancer treatment,&#x201D; said Alex Weiss, chair of UTA&#x2019;s Department of Physics. &#x201C;This new work is exemplary of the spirit of discovery we strive to embody at UTA. I look forward to what Dr. Chen and his collaborators can accomplish in the coming phases of this research as they pioneer a potential new avenue for combatting cancer.&#x201D;</p>"

UTA&#x2019;s share in the grant is $321,608 for two years.</p><p>Liu researches how to use lasers to deliver near-infrared light to the human brain to detect traumatic brain injuries and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Her recent work has broadened to investigate the neurophysiological principle of non-invasive delivery of near-infrared laser light to improve human cognition. This research has led to an understanding of how light can stimulate mitochondria, which are the powerhouses within cells, into creating more oxygen in the brain to increase cerebral metabolism and mitigate memory loss.</p><p>With the new grant, Liu will investigate whether light-emitting diodes, or LED, can replace lasers as the delivery method for near-infrared light. Specifically, she will find the wavelength range and duration necessary to produce the desired effects.</p><p>In general, lasers are heavy and bulky and would take too much space in the cramped quarters of a spacecraft or space station. LEDs are lighter and smaller and could be attached to a headband or similar device more easily stowed. Also, light delivered by LED is safer to human eyes than light from lasers.</p><p>LED light in the red and near-infrared range is already in widespread use for relieving pain and treating acne, although few researchers have rigorously investigated its feasibility and limitation for boosting and stimulating brain metabolism.</p><p>&#x201C;Researchers have evidence that memory can be improved right after shining light on specific areas of the human brain for eight to 10 minutes,&#x201D; Liu said. &#x201C;We are trying to demonstrate that if we can increase power in LEDs within safe levels, we can make LED light reach the cortex, just like a laser, but safer, smaller, easier and more portable to use.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu&#x2019;s research is an example of <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a>, two themes of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Michael Cho, chair of the Bioengineering Department.</p><p>&#x201C;Workplace pressure is difficult to deal with on Earth, but adding the stressors of an environment such as space can have negative effects and impacts on performance and memory,&#x201D; Cho said. &#x201C;Dr. Liu&#x2019;s research has made important strides in this area, and if she is successful, her work on this new grant could be a crucial component of long-duration space exploration.&#x201D;</p><p>Liu&#x2019;s recent technology-based research and development is related to non-invasive transcranial infrared brain stimulations, or TIBS, In 2016, she led a team that published groundbreaking research in Nature&#x2019;s&#xA0;<i>Scientific Reports</i>&#xA0;that explained the underlying principle of TIBS, followed by another high-impact article in the&#xA0;<i>Journal of</i>&#xA0;<i>Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism.&#xA0;</i>This publication has provided the first demonstration that TIBS can significantly improve metabolic activity, blood flow and blood oxygenation in the human brain.</p><p>She also teamed with Alexa Smith-Osborne, a retired UTA associate professor of social work, and used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to map brain activity responses during cognitive task performance related to digit learning and memory retrial. This optical mapping method permits neural scientists and/or clinicians to &#x201C;see&#x201D; where memory fails within the brain among student veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>&#xFEFF;-- Writen by Jeremy Agor</em></p>"

He mentors current Movin&#x2019; Mavs, talking to them about game strategy, opponents&#x2019; tendencies and how to cope with life&#x2019;s challenges.</p><p>&#x201C;UTA has always been a huge part of my life because of the time I spent here,&#x201D; Gouge said. &#x201C;I want to see these guys get as much out of it as I did.&#x201D;</p><p>The first tournament is the <a href=\"http://events.uta.edu/event/dk3_on_3_wheelchair_basketball_tournament#.XPBcGdNKiys\">DK3 Tournament</a>, a 3-on-3 national wheelchair basketball tournament named after Dave Kiley a National Wheelchair Basketball hall of famer and former U.S. Paralympian. Teams are sorted based on classification, skill level and experience. The round robin format guarantees each team five games. It will be in the Maverick Activities Center&#x2019;s main gym.</p><p>In addition to Gouge, several other former and current UTA Movin&#x2019; Mavs will play.</p><p>&#x201C;Playing 3-on-3 is a faster game. It&#x2019;s half court and very fast,&#x201D; Gouge said. &#x201C;There will be a lot of Team USA players here for that one. It&#x2019;s different in that you sign up and they assign you teams. You&#x2019;re playing with people you&#x2019;ve never played with before and that makes it fun.&#x201D;</p><p>The second tournament is with the USA Senior Men&#x2019;s National Team versus national teams from Japan and Spain. UTA&#x2019;s team will play in for a couple of the games at the MAC and the physical education building.</p><p>Gouge said the second tournament will help prepare many of the athletes for participation in the Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, later this summer and for the 2020 Paralympics in Tokyo. In the 2016 Paralympics, UTA placed three players on the men&#x2019;s team and two on the women&#x2019;s team.</p><p>Gouge has lived with a bone deficiency all his life. He discovered wheelchair basketball when he was 11. Now at 33, he has been a Team USA player for the past six years.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t an easy road there, though.</p><p>&#x201C;There is a lot of pressure every year but it keeps you working hard,&#x201D; Gouge said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s never a guarantee, though.&#x201D;</p><p>One of the UTA alumni joining Gouge will be William Hernandez, founder of PER4MAX in Grand Prairie, a maker of high-performance sports wheelchairs. After contracting polio, he began playing wheelchair basketball in junior high and became the first disabled student in the United States to earn a full athletic scholarship, leading UTA to three national titles. He graduated with a UTA mechanical engineering degree before founding PER4MAX. Gouge does quality control at PER4MAX.</p><p>In 2014, Hernandez received the Texas Governor&#x2019;s Committee on People with Disabilities&#x2019; Lex Frieden Employment Award.</p><p>&#x201C;Wheelchair basketball&#xA0;opened so many doors for me,&#x201D; Hernandez says. &#x201C;I owe&#xA0;my career, personal, and professional successes to the opportunities UTA provided.&#x201D;</p><p>Doug Garner, coach of the Movin&#x2019; Mavs, is looking forward to seeing all the returning players at the two tournaments.</p><p>&#x201C;It does our current Movin&#x2019; Mavs players so much good to see what success looks like,&#x201D; Garner said. &#x201C;It also helps them know what kind of player they have to face on the world stage.&#x201D;</p><p>See a video of Aaron Gouge <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rusp6Ksni6I&amp;list=PLqOXGF7mET-kn8LVSLRje8SLRa5KcpqPL&amp;index=4\">here</a>.</p>"

They reference a band from UTA they heard while in college, but there&#x2019;s no record of that band or their recordings. Without an archive of that music, we lose the ability to draw connections between artists and cultural shifts.&#x201D;</p><p>MusicDetour, established as a nonprofit, has two primary functions: to preserve the music of North Texas-based artists past and present and to act as a nonprofit streaming service that allows people to revisit and discover music. Arditi said he hopes to utilize data to develop a community and facilitate connections.</p><p>The platform originally began as a database for shows at regional venues while Arditi was living in Virginia. He noticed there were patterns appearing in the data; of note was that the same kinds of bands were performing at the same kinds of venues. The idea became a platform where audience members could find bands they might like based on bands they had seen recently.</p><p>MusicDetour was reinvented for its current purpose when Arditi came to UTA and collaborated with colleagues in the College of Liberal Arts to expand its work in the digital humanities.</p><p>Beth Anne Shelton, chair of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, said Arditi&#x2019;s work is a dynamic example of the University&#x2019;s commitment to <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Data is more than the conventional perception of computers and numbers; data gives us insight into our commonalities and how we behave within our community,&#x201D; Shelton said. &#x201C;Data represents humans, and David is putting that on display with MusicDetour as he endeavors to develop a community around our local musicians.&#x201D;</p><p>Arditi said the nonprofit approach to music is unconventional, but allows artists to share their music with no risk and no cost while preventing local independent music from sliding into oblivion.</p><p>To date, there are more than 50 bands, some current and some of days past, in the MusicDetour archive. Arditi said he hopes to expand now that the renovated website is up and running.</p><p>While expanding the North Texas music library is the main goal of MusicDetour, Arditi said he hopes someday to adapt it to other communities. Current plans include philanthropic efforts to fund student workers for more comprehensive curation and artist outreach.</p><p>&#x201C;We accept music from any local musician who owns the copyrights to their material,&#x201D; Arditi said. &#x201C;UTA alumni can play an essential role in helping us expand this platform. If they played in a band while they were a student here, we&#x2019;d love to get that music.&#x201D;</p>"

Eventually, many will compete in the 2020 Paralympics in Tokyo.</p><p>Doug Garner, coach of the Movin&#x2019; Mavs, said the success these Lady Movin&#x2019; Mavs have had speaks volumes about The University of Texas at Arlington&#x2019;s dedication to wheelchair basketball. The Lady Movin&#x2019; Mavs started play in 2013. Since then, the team has earned two national championships.</p><p>&#x201C;Team USA does a great job at identifying talent, and that talent falls squarely here at UTA,&#x201D; Garner said. &#x201C;Tournaments like this and the Paralympics provide a next step for these world-class athletes and on their journeys.&#x201D;</p><p>Team USA was dominant in the tournament. Australia was its closest competitor earlier in the competition, losing to Team USA by 25 points. Team USA defeated Australia in the championship game 62-25.</p><p>&#x201C;The team is feeling pretty awesome right now,&#x201D; Dunkin said. &#x201C;Huge accolades to Australia and Great Britain and all the other teams that have been here. They really put up a fight and it&#x2019;s been really awesome to see all the girls coming together all round the sport.&#x201D;</p><p>She said the tournament highlighted more than basketball.</p><p>&#x201C;For some of the girls it is their first time meeting other athletes from different countries and cultures,&#x201D; Dunkin said. &#x201C;It gave us a chance to all get together, take pictures and develop friendships, which has been a really cool aspect to the tournament.&#x201D;</p><p>Dunkin and Hollermann made the tournament&#x2019;s All-Star Five. So did Lindsay, who also was the tournament&#x2019;s top scorer with 110 points. Hollermann was named Most Valuable Player.</p><p>Apart from its status as a destination university for adaptive athletes, UTA is one of the nation&#x2019;s leading institutions providing students with disabilities access to high quality educational opportunities. UTA was the first university in the nation to offer full-ride scholarships for athletes in adapted sports. UTA&#x2019;s disability studies minor was the first such program in the south and is one of only about 30 in the nation.</p><p>Wheelchair basketball became a sport at UTA in 1976 as a recreational event for students with disabilities. On the men&#x2019;s side, it became a recognized intercollegiate athletic program in 1988, with intercollegiate play beginning the following year. The Movin&#x2019; Mavs have won eight collegiate championships.</p><p>In 2019, the Lady Movin&#x2019; Mavs fell just short of back-to-back national championships, losing 82-76 in overtime to Alabama in March.</p>"

The theme of the 2019 event is &#x201C;Making Leaders Is Our Mission.&#x201D;</p><p>The organization&#x2019;s curriculum focuses on an individual&#x2019;s personal responsibility and commitment to lead and what impact he or she can have on society. The seminars are led by dedicated alumni and volunteers, along with local leaders from the business, education, science, technology and government sectors.</p><p>HOBY programs are conducted annually throughout the United States, serving local and international high school students.

They saw a leader and a potential to do good, and they helped me grow so I can do good.&#x201D;</p><p>At a 2018 HOBY banquet for outstanding youth alumni, Mudvari&#x2019;s keynote speech helped the organization double its goal and raise $40,000 in a single evening.</p><p>At UTA, he plans to study communications and public relations.</p><p>&#x201C;UTA already has done so much for me, and it is the only university I have seen that really involves itself with the community,&#x201D; Mudvari said. &#x201C;UTA actually cares about people, and I think the school will help me grow.&#x201D;</p>"

We have a lot to be proud of and to share with the world, and this gives us a global platform to do that.&#x201D;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tare&#xA0;leveraged working relationships already in place between UTA and other organizations to get the ball rolling. At their kickoff meeting in January, 60 stakeholders from the region were asked&#xA0;to pick sustainable development goals they thought were most relevant to the region. The consensus: good health and well-being, sustainable communities and education.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#x201C;We drafted the application and submitted it to the UNU-IAS, and I also asked the stakeholders to share information about their programs and provide a letter of support to go with the application,&#x201D; she said. Another working meeting was held this month to decide on mission and vision statements, and one-year and five-year goals.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The group concluded that one of the reasons the coalition is needed is because the North Texas region has experienced such tremendous growth over the past 40 years. Population is expected to double by the year 2050. In this scenario, as noted in the application, &#x201C;we should examine how North Texas will confront the exploding population projections and the environmental, social and economic challenges they bring.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#x201C;Formation of a Regional Centre of Expertise on Education for Sustainable Development would be an influencer in the community as cities expand, providing the resources to maximize the potential economic opportunity that well-managed communities can offer. The status quo is not sustainable; North Texas must embrace a proactive approach to addressing the challenges of urbanization.&#x201D;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tare said she is committed to including more grassroots organizations and private businesses in the RCE&#xA0;North Texas&#xA0;and that some consulting firms and small businesses have already expressed interest in joining the effort.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#x201C;As much as possible, we want to be focused on education, dialogue and collaboration of ideas,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Many businesses are designing their strategies around sustainable development, and we want to give them a chance to leverage our expertise and resources.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Academia also is recognizing that the time is right to take its knowledge and expertise outside the campus.&#xA0;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#x201C;Sustainable development engenders a culture of learning and continuous improvement. The RCE network brings together members who might not usually work together,&#x201D; said John Hall, UTA vice president for administration and campus operations. &#x201C;As such, they are uniquely placed to help create solutions to sustainability challenges through dialogue, education, training, conferences, symposiums and learning.&#x201D;</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Anyone interested in promoting sustainability is invited to attend the Regional Centre of Expertise&#xA0;on Education for Sustainable Development North Texas&#xA0;kickoff from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday, March 28, at The University of Texas at Arlington E.H.

A total of 12,518 students are currently enrolled in the program.</p><p>In his remarks at the 10<sup>th</sup>&#xA0;anniversary celebration, UTA president Vistasp Karbhari said the success of the initial program led to 14 additional online programs within the College of Nursing.</p><p>Just as gratifying, he continued, is the program&#x2019;s reputation for excellence around the state and nationally. &#x201C;Our nurses are highly-sought after,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;Hundreds of thousands of patients in this state are privileged to be served by the nurses who were educated at UTA. The College of Nursing and Health Innovation is the tip of the spear in online education, and the country has taken notice.&#x201D;</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption400\"><img alt=\"CoNHI celebrated a decade of the RN-to-BSN program\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/rn-to-bsn-10-year.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>CoNHI celebrated a decade of the RN-to-BSN program recently.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>The RN-to-BSN program&#x2019;s creation was spurred largely by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing&#x2019;s 80 percent BSN by 2020 Initiative, which has the goal of ensuring that 80 percent of the nation&#x2019;s registered nurses have bachelor&#x2019;s degrees by 2020. Several studies have shown that hospitals with a higher percentage of nurses with BSN degrees give better patient care</p><p>Encouraged by the popularity of the program, college officials moved to expand most of their graduate nursing degrees online, making an advanced nursing education more accessible to students throughout the state and around the country. As a result of these online offerings, the college&#x2019;s total enrollment has increased in recent years, reaching about 20,000 per semester. Two-thirds of these students take courses online, which offer the same education as attending in a classroom.</p><p>UTA&#x2019;s RN-to-BSN program accounts for 7 percent of the national market and 75 percent of the Texas market, said Rob Ganji, president of Academic Partnerships.</p><p>Dean Merwin said she&#x2019;s impressed by what she&#x2019;s seen of the program in the short time she&#x2019;s been at UTA and is optimistic about the future.</p><p>&#x201C;I look forward to the next decade and to building on our successes and contributions,&#x201D; she said.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>&#xA0;-- written by Lekan&#xA0;Oguntoyinbo</em></p>"

Program participants include veterans, first-generation students, low-income students and students with disabilities.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/trio-funding-2019.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>TRIO pre-college staff members</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>&#x201C;UTA has a great track record of support that brings more students into higher education,&#x201D; said Troy Johnson, vice president for enrollment management. &#x201C;These TRIO programs make all the difference.&#x201D;</p><p>The federal TRIO programs are outreach and student services programs designed to identify and provide services for individuals from traditionally under-represented and disadvantaged backgrounds. TRIO includes programs that target and assist students through an academic pipeline from middle school to post-baccalaureate programs. More than 840,000 students &#x2014; from sixth-graders to college graduates &#x2014; are served by more than 2,900 programs nationally.</p><p>TRIO pre-college programs were first funded at UTA through the Upward Bound program in 1982. Eight additional competitive grants have been awarded to the University since then for continued funding. Most recently in 2017, the Upward Bound Math and Science program in Dallas was funded.</p><p>For Sergio Gutierrez, a 2014 UTA mechanical engineering graduate who now works at Lockheed Martin, the positive results from the Upward Bound program were substantial.</p><p>&#x201C;I always considered myself a hard-working and bright student,&#x201D; Gutierrez said. &#x201C;Upward Bound continued to promote those good habits and traits and built on them. They helped me with whatever questions I had and advice leading into college. As a first generation American this was key because no one in my family had gone to college in America before me. My parents do have degrees but in Mexico and the process there is different.&#x201D;</p><p>Gutierrez said Upward Bound helped him earn a four-year scholarship and find funding for two UTA summer classes covered by the program.</p><p>&#x201C;I wasn&#x2019;t as worried about the finance of school because of grants and that financial aid. Overall, Upward Bound was a great support system, similar to a family. It provides a cultural enrichment of activities via trips and field work to other parts of the country during the summer program.&#x201D;</p><p>In TRIO, each student participant works with a student development specialist to explore his or her current academic needs and the resources available, then develops a plan of action. The specialists are knowledgeable of UTA&#x2019;s and other colleges&#x2019; and universities&#x2019; requirements and expectations. They help the participants find solutions to problems they may encounter.</p><p>&#x201C;The coaching and mentoring these participants receive are individualized,&#x201D; said Lisa Thompson, senior director for pre-college programs. &#x201C;One student might need more help in the academic realm. Another might need more help in finances for college. Still another might require personal and social coaching.&#x201D;</p><p>In addition to coaching, forums are held on academic and life-skills learning, financial education and other important topics. Finally, participants are prepared for university rigors through peer-assisted study sessions and tutoring.</p><p>&#x201C;Our staff has a real heart for the students served by the TRIO programs,&#x201D; Thompson said. &#x201C;You can see that in the positive results we get with our participants. Many of them go on to earn advanced degrees. That helps them. It helps UTA. But, more importantly, it helps society.&#x201D;</p>"

One type of abstraction&#x2014;virtualization&#x2014;is a key component of cloud computing and has changed how computer systems use resources by allowing multiple virtual computer architectures and systems to run off of a single physical machine. However, performance, cost-effectiveness and predictability issues are keeping virtualization out of domains such as scientific computing and big-data analytics.</p><p>&#x201C;The problem with existing abstractions in virtual systems is that, despite the benefits to cloud computing, abstractions incur a lot of inefficiency and unpredictability to cloud users,&#x201D; Rao said. &#x201C;Our intention is to improve resource management in any kind of virtual system to enable elastic, effective and efficient use of those resources.&#x201D;</p><p>Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual copy of real physical resources to help ease the management of computer systems and allow maximum flexibility in resource management. Using virtualization, it is possible to build a computer system where several virtual machines, each assigned to different users, can run off one physical machine. However, it is difficult to meet each individual&#x2019;s needs and maintain high utilization and efficiency in the system due to semantic gaps, or critical missing information between levels of abstraction.</p><p>For instance, a user of a virtual machine has the illusion of a dedicated resource and continuous availability, but those resources are actually built upon a physical resource shared among many users. Since resource management software was designed for a physical system with continuous availability, the software doesn&#x2019;t work efficiently in a virtualized environment because each user&#x2019;s demands on the physical system are different.</p><p>&#x201C;We hope to bridge these semantic gaps by augmenting existing, regularly adopted abstractions while retaining the benefits of abstraction, including modality, security and portability,&#x201D; Rao said. &#x201C;We will then use the knowledge we develop in designing abstractions in virtualized systems to guide the design of abstractions in future hardware systems that will support multi-tenacy.&#x201D;</p><p>His research is an example of data-driven discovery, one of the themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact, said Peter Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering.</p><p>&#x201C;Cloud computing has changed how the world uses computer networks, and Dr. Rao&#x2019;s research will make the cloud more efficient. This could lead to even greater opportunities for business, the scientific community and anyone who uses the cloud as part of their daily lives,&#x201D; Crouch said.&#xA0;</p><p>Seven other UTA faculty have received NSF CAREER Award grants while employed at the University:</p><ul><li>Matthew Walsh of the Biology Department received $600,000 in 2017 to study whether behavioral plasticity promotes or constrains adaptation.</li><li>Majie Fan of the Earth and Environmental Sciences Department received $485,627 in 2015 to enhance understanding of how the Rocky Mountains and its modern, elevated landscape came to be.</li><li>Yi Hong in the Bioengineering Department received $500,000 in 2016 to develop a polymer that will allow engineers to develop a scaffold that is flexible, conductive and biodegradable for biomedical applications such as tissue repair.</li><li>Junzhou Huang of the Computer Science and Engineering Department received $545,763 in 2016 to discover a process by which image-omics data can be combined into files that are small enough that current computing technology will allow scientists to better predict how long a patient will live and how best to treat him or her.</li><li>Ankur Jain in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department received $500,000 in 2016 to develop a fundamental understanding of how heat flows in materials within a Li-ion battery so they can be used safely in more applications.</li><li>Alice Sun in the Electrical Engineering Department received $500,000 in 2016 to develop an all-liquid optofluidic laser that could better detect cancer in the comfort of a doctor&#x2019;s office.</li><li>Kyungsuk Yum in the Materials Science and Engineering Department received $500,000 to design and develop bioinspired 3D materials with programmed shapes and motions.</li></ul><p>The Computer Science and Engineering Department offers degrees in computer engineering, computer science and software engineering.

The two have been friends for almost 25 years after meeting in graduate school at Seoul National University.</p><p>Kihwan Kim, who has worked at POSCO for 10 years, has come to UTA and will be on campus for the entire year to help with the feasibility study as a business scholar.</p><p>&#x201C;Steelmaking companies like POSCO have such large and complex production facilities, similar to petrochemical plants,&#x201D; Kihwan Kim said. &#x201C;The companies always seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of inspection and maintenance of those facilities. Recent developments of intelligent robot technologies have drawn our attention greatly. Through this project, I hope to find some great ideas of robot applications for steelmaking facilities. Particularly, we will focus on robotics for harsh and hazardous environments such as high temperature, strong radiation and severe dust.&#x201D;</p><p>Daejong Kim said robots could certainly be valuable to help at steelmaking facilities.</p><p>&#x201C;Underneath these plants is a huge maze of electrical wires,&#x201D; Daejong Kim said. &#x201C;When there is too much of an overload in electrical wires a fire can start, and once that happens it&#x2019;s difficult to control because of the toxic gas underground&#x2014;it&#x2019;s highly combustible. Even firefighters have difficulty going in. We want to develop some kind of robotic system that can go in and monitor the temperature, and if the wires get too hot the robot can detect and monitor the location of the high-temperature spot and avoid a fire hazard. The robot should be able to avoid obstacles in front of it, carry infrared cameras, and have arms and legs and multiple sensors to detect the problems.</p><p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re not developing an actual robot now,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;Once the feasibility study is done, the next step is to develop the robot. The study is identifying what kind of functionality is needed with the robot.&#x201D;</p><p>Daejong Kim moved from South Korea to the United States in 2000 and received his doctorate degree from the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>Kihwan Kim believes Dr. Kim is the right person to lead this feasibility study.</p><p>&#x201C;I would like to achieve practice results rather than just theoretical ideas, and Professor Kim has lots of experience in industrial application, which has been very successful,&#x201D; Kihwan Kim said. &#x201C;So, I found that his strength could fit nicely to our goal. I also found out that UTA has strong traditions of engineering, including great people and facilities. It has been a great pleasure to work together with UTA researchers so far.&#x201D;</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Brandon George</em></p>"

The program has earned a national reputation for its excellence and affordability. Most recently, Valuecolleges.com ranked it the sixth best registered nurse-to-bachelor of science in nursing program in the country.</p><p>&#x201C;The program is good. The instructors are amazing. And the college listens to student feedback,&#x201D; said Minaz Dungor, a May 2015 graduate of the program who said she was attracted to the program because of its flexibility and UTA&#x2019;s reputation as a respected public university.</p><p>&#x201C;Listening to feedback makes students feel like their voice is heard,&#x201D; added Dungor, who returned to UTA and graduated with a master&#x2019;s of science in nursing degree in December 2018.</p><p>The RN-to-BSN program&#x2019;s creation was spurred largely by the 80 percent BSN by 2020 Initiative. The goal of the initiative is to ensure that 80 percent of the nation&#x2019;s registered nurses have bachelor&#x2019;s degrees by 2020. Several studies have shown an increase in patient care at hospitals with a higher percentage of nurses with BSN degrees.</p><p>&#x201C;UTA was very forward thinking and was a frontrunner among nursing schools in developing a first-rate online nursing program,&#x201D; said Pamela White, a UTA accelerated online program manager and a clinical assistant professor of nursing.</p><p>Prior to launching the program, UTA officials worked diligently to determine and integrate best practices in online education.</p><p>&#x201C;These included the use of discussion boards to accelerate student engagement and a feeling of community, using small group sizes and short video clips to enhance materials,&#x201D; White said.&#xA0; &#x201C;Instead of having students listen to three-hour lectures, we included short video clips to stimulate students&#x2019; critical thinking.&#x201D;</p><p>Encouraged by the popularity of the program, college officials moved to expand most of their graduate nursing degrees online, making an advanced nursing education more accessible to students throughout the state and around the country. As a result of these online offerings, the college&#x2019;s enrollment has increased in recent years, exceeding 20,000. Two-thirds of these students take classes online, which offer the same education as attending in a classroom.</p><p>The program has become more flexible and accessible over the years, making it easier for students to graduate on time, White said.</p><p>&#x201C;Initially not every course was offered every time online,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Now the courses are offered on a consistent basis every six weeks, which makes it easier for students who want to complete it within a certain time frame or take two courses at a time.&#x201D;</p><p>The college will host a celebration of the program at 4 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 7 at the E.H.

In early 2019, a multi-species rapid tissue loss disease matching the description of stony coral tissue loss disease was discovered severely affecting a reef off the southwest coast of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p>The disease has been devastating coral reef communities off the southeast coast of Florida since 2014 and was recently reported in other areas of the Caribbean, including Mexico, St. Martin and Jamaica. Scientists believe it will likely spread across the U.S. Virgin Islands, British Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.</p><p>&#x201C;My lab will assess immunity and disease resistance in coral based on a unique combination of immune phenotypes including expressed genes and protein activity,&#x201D; Mydlarz said. &#x201C;This approach of full transcriptome sequencing, paired with analysis models that include organismal phenotypes, will allow us to build pathways and turn groups of genes into immune traits.&#x201D;</p><p>Stony coral tissue loss disease differs from the &#x201C;bleaching&#x201D; that is damaging coral reefs around the world. Bleaching is caused by thermal stress and begins by killing symbiotic algae that live on corals. There is a possibility that bleached corals can recover over time. Stony coral tissue loss disease appears to be a spreading pathogen and is capable of killing an entire coral in five weeks, according to Marilyn Brandt, University of the Virgin Islands research associate professor of marine and environmental science and lead investigator of the project.</p><p>Researchers will perform experiments to discover how this disease affects coral species&#x2019; immune traits and compare the microbiology and physiology of disease samples in the Virgin Islands to samples from Florida. They will also examine how changing the species composition of a coral community affects the spread and impact of the disease.</p><p>&#x201C;The onset of this [outbreak] in the USVI offers an unprecedented opportunity to test hypotheses about the impact of coral resistance, tolerance and immune traits on disease spread during the early stages of an outbreak that could profoundly change the diversity of Caribbean reefs,&#x201D; the researchers wrote in their abstract for the project.</p><p>Mydlarz and her colleagues hope that the study will provide a better understanding of how the abundance of highly susceptible host species impacts the spread of disease during the early onset of a multi-species outbreak over a wide geographic area.</p><p>In addition to UTA, the project includes researchers from the University of the Virgin Islands, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution of Massachusetts, Rice University, Louisiana State University and Mote Marine Laboratory of Florida.</p><p>Clay Clark, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Biology, said the project can provide important information for the battle against coral disease and reef loss, and noted that it expands UTA&#x2019;s footprint in the area of global environmental impact.</p><p>&#x201C;The team that Dr. Mydlarz is a part of is doing critical work in the fight against coral disease and coral reef loss,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;If they&#x2019;re able to create a model to help predict what effect the spread of disease has on coral reefs, it would be a significant step forward in helping scientists devise the best way to fight these diseases.&#x201D;</p>"

Jay Professor in College of Nursing and Health Innovation</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Marco Brotto&#x2014;the George W. and Hazel M. Jay Professor in the college, and an internationally renowned scientist and an expert in bone, muscle physiology and sarcopenia&#x2014;recently obtained renewal for two grants, and funding for three new grants from the National Institutes of Health. These awards will further his work in tackling sarcopenia and osteoporosis, and support his new work on diabetic skeletal muscle disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s disease.</p><p>Sarcopenia, the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and muscle strength, is prevalent in the aging population and affects 30 to 45 percent of people over the age of 60. It contributes to debilitating injuries, loss of independence, reduced quality of life in the elderly and more than $40 billion in health care costs in the United States alone, according to Brotto. Musculoskeletal diseases affect more than one in two adults and run up health care expenses of about $1 trillion around the world annually, Brotto said.</p><p>&#x201C;Our view of aging is changing as we live longer,&#x201D; said Brotto, who heads the college&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/conhi/research/bmrc/index.php\">Bone-Muscle Research Center</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;Who would want to live longer and be sick, full of chronic disorders? Aging affects the human musculoskeletal, or MSK, system, causing an array of problems from premature deaths to serious disabilities,&#x201D; Brotto said. &#x201C;Our studies over the next five years aim to advance discovery of how aging leads to osteoporosis, sarcopenia, diabetes, etc. This knowledge will translate into new diagnostics and treatments for MSK disorders and aging decline in MSK function.&#x201D;</p><p>Paul Fadel, the college&#x2019;s associate dean for research, said the outcome of Brotto&#x2019;s work could lead to significant living improvements for the elderly and ultimately for all people.</p><p>&#x201C;With 10,000 people turning 65 each day, it is incumbent to seek solutions that further advance health and the quality of life for this population,&#x201D; Fadel said. &#x201C;These studies will help us take gigantic steps in achieving that. As you age, your risk for falls increases because you&#x2019;re losing strength and balance. And this increases your risk for fractures, which can be very debilitating. Dr. Brotto and his team are tackling these problems from a variety of important angles.&#x201D;</p><p>Elizabeth Merwin, dean of the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, said, &#x201C;These grants are a boon for the college, for UTA and for health care. These studies are potentially transformative. The outcome of the work of Dr. Brotto and his team of fellow researchers could significantly enhance the quality of life of the elderly.&#x201D;</p><p>Following are snapshots of the five NIH grants:</p><p><b>Bone-Muscle Crosstalk: bone cells regulation of skeletal muscle function&#x2014;</b>This grant is part of a special NIH mechanism called Program Project Grant, or PPG, involving four principal Investigators, or PIs, at Indiana University, the University of Missouri-Kansas City and UTA. Brotto is the PI of Project 2 of this PPG. He will use this $1.89 million grant to determine how bone cells can influence and change the function of muscles by releasing hormone-like molecules. Brotto has discovered that this process is altered with aging.</p><p><b>Regulation of store-operated calcium entry during muscle aging</b>:&#x2014;Brotto will use this $1.97 million grant to examine the mechanisms that contribute to the loss of strength in muscle during aging and determine if regulating certain proteins can improve the function of aged skeletal muscles. He is collaborating with Professor Noah Weisleder at Ohio State University.</p><p><b>Loss of a protein in muscle dysfunction in aging</b>&#x2014;With this $1 million grant, Brotto and his team will work with Christopher Cardozo, a professor at the Icahn School of School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, to investigate the role of a protein called &#x201C;numb&#x201D; in muscle function and weakness with aging. He believes the knowledge is likely to increase understanding of the causes of muscle weakness. &#x201C;It could lead to treatments to prevent and mitigate weakness and frailty in the elderly,&#x201D; Brotto said.</p><p><b>Protecting the diabetic skeletal muscle by Nampt activation</b>&#x2014;The major objective of this $965,000 grant is to develop Nampt, or protein gene activators, to protect skeletal muscles from diabetes. &#x201C;Diabetes is a metabolic disease associated with skeletal muscle injury,&#x201D; Brotto said. &#x201C;This research project will generate high-impact pharmacological data through the discovery of new agents and develop molecular insights into preventing muscle injury in diabetes.&#x201D; Brotto is collaborating with Srinivas Tipparaju, an associate professor in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of South Florida.</p><p><b>Alleviating the progression of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS</b>&#x2014;Research shows that muscles appear to be primary targets as the ALS gene mutates. This is the primary research topic of Jingsong Zhou, UTA professor of kinesiology and associate director of the Bone-Muscle Research Center. In collaboration with the Zhou team, Brotto and his team plan to use this $750,000 grant to develop alternative therapeutic strategies for combatting ALS.</p><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Lekan&#xA0;Oguntoyinbo</em></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>"

After winning the competition, the students presented a paper based on their findings at the 2018 AIAA Space and Astronautics Forum, where it caught the attention of Aviation Week writer Steve Trimble.</p><p>&#x201C;Hypersonic weapon systems have been in the news recently, with various adversaries independently conducting tests of hypersonic glide vehicles or HGVs, and there are currently no existing weapons system to defend against them now,&#x201D; Peace said. &#x201C;Many defense companies are focused on developing a hypersonic weapon, but only limited progress has been made toward a deployable counter-weapon.&#x201D;</p><p>The winning design was a single-stage &#x201C;hit-to-kill&#x201D; missile system, named ARX, to intercept hypersonic glide vehicles, or HGVs, during cruise. HGVs are launched as payloads atop conventional launch vehicles, separate at the top of the launch arc, then glide through the atmosphere in a series of banks and weaves. Complicating matters, the altitude of the flight path and geometric constraints due to the Earth&#x2019;s curvature keep the HGVs out of sight of ground-based radar equipment until the vehicle crests the horizon, leaving little time for defenses to react.</p><p>The conceptual design relied on a mathematical model that integrated the aerodynamic characteristics, propulsion sizing, and structural constraints with the missile guidance and trajectory algorithm. The team also developed several engineering tools, custom-made for the problem at hand, to aid the conceptual design.</p><p>Ideally, ARX is capable of defending a several mile radius against non-maneuvering and maneuvering HGVs at a high altitude and at a high speed. The missile is equipped with a blast fragmentation feature to increase its lethality, so that even if the missile fails to hit the HGV, there is a chance that the fragments will hit and neutralize the HGV.</p><p>&#x201C;I really believe that this is a good concept that would actually work. This competition brought out a lot of talent and imaginative ideas,&#x201D; Lu said.</p><p>The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering offers bachelor&#x2019;s, master&#x2019;s and doctoral degrees in mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering. The aerospace engineering program ranked No. 48 and the mechanical engineering program, No. 87, in U.S. News and World Report&#x2019;s 2019 graduate rankings. The FSAE, or Formula Society of Automotive Engineering, program has a storied past. Dating back 45 years, UTA has taken three international and eight national championships and has debuted innovative changes in the automotive industry, including wings to reduce drag and an all-electric racecar. The Aerodynamics Research Center houses the only university-housed, arc-heated hypersonic wind tunnel in the United States, as well as low-speed, transonic, supersonic, arc jet and hypersonic shock wind tunnels.</p><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div><div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>"

It&#x2019;s a balance between efficiency and the social aspect of making sure that farmers can thrive and earn a living,&#x201D; Krejci said.</p><p>Texas is a large state with many small-scale agricultural operations, defined for Krejci&#x2019;s study as farmers and ranchers who are selling produce, dairy, eggs or meat to regional markets or are interested in doing so. Farmers who grow commodities such as cotton are not included in the study.</p><p>To reach urban customers, many farmers use their own vehicles to drive to farmers&#x2019; markets, but regions often become saturated with too many markets, and competition drives prices down. As an alternative, some farmers sell directly to restaurants and grocery stores, but the small volumes being transported make it very expensive to hire a logistics company, and frequent in-person deliveries are inefficient and time-consuming.</p><p>Possible solutions include banding together to fill a truck and bring down shipping costs, or sharing warehousing space.</p><p>Krejci has identified farmers in three different regions who have already begun collaborating with other farmers in their communities to create better ways to transport food: a hydroponic farmer in Lucas (northeast of Dallas), an organic vegetable farmer in the Rio Grande Valley who leads the South Texas Alliance of Young Farmers, and a permaculture farmer located northwest of Houston who is a leader in the Waller County Farmers and Ranchers Co-op. Krejci will work with them to determine how to make their collaborations more efficient and resilient and whether there are best practices and technology that could be used to link producers across the entire state.</p><p>Krejci&#x2019;s work is an example of sustainable urban communities, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020. In addition to helping farmers and ranchers, her research could go a long way in solving the problem of getting fresh food to poorer sections of urban areas, said Paul Componation, chair of the Industrial, Manufacturing and Systems Engineering Department.</p><p>&#x201C;Efficiency in moving and storing goods, as well as growing practices that capitalize on optimal conditions that benefit everyone involved, from growers to consumers, will make a real impact on the economy of the State of Texas, creating better income streams for producers, logistics suppliers and the food industry,&#x201D; Componation said. &#x201C;This is a huge project with many upsides, and I&#x2019;m confident that Dr. Krejci&#x2019;s work will benefit Texans many times over.&#x201D;</p><p>The Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program was authorized as part of the 1985 Farm Bill. It supports farmers, researchers and educators in developing practices that improve stewardship, profitability and the social and economic health of farm communities.

If they are not treated, they can cause the alloys to break down and impact the ship&#x2019;s seaworthiness. Huang&#x2019;s research will focus on degradations that are early in their development, when they are so small that they are undetectable by current sensors.</p><p>&#x201C;This type of technology goes beyond normal maintenance for a ship. It captures valuable data about the material state before it becomes a much larger problem. By detecting them earlier, we&#x2019;re hoping it can drastically reduce the maintenance costs in the long run,&#x201D; Huang said.</p><p>Huang will establish new simulation and experiment techniques to determine the effects of adhesives on the transducers, as well as the effects of material degradation on the signals. She also plans to develop new transducer designs and control strategies for better detection and characterization of material degradation that could help the Navy with maintenance, operation and safety on its ships.</p><p>Huang will use a three-year, $299,973 grant from the Office of Naval Research to investigate the use of optical fibers as ultrasound waveguides to create sensor networks that can be implemented to detect when and where damage occurs within a structure.</p><p>These networks could be key components for structural health monitoring, the process of continuously checking the condition of components of buildings, ships and other structures in real time.</p><p>&#x201C;Structural health monitoring is a growing technology because of its potential to provide substantial benefits in safety, operational costs and design. We are working to create networks that would allow remote monitoring or make it possible for a few sensors to monitor a very large area, which would speed detection before issues become dangerous,&#x201D; Huang said.</p><p>Most ultrasound sensing is conducted with transducers that require electric wiring. However, wired transducers add a great deal of weight to a structure and are difficult to maintain, especially on a ship that is exposed to sea water.</p><p>Huang will attempt to investigate wave coupling, or the transmission of ultrasound waves, between two waveguides to create optical fiber-based ultrasound sensor networks that could be configured to detect certain types of waves. These networks would be lightweight, effective and easy to maintain.</p><p>Waveguides such as optical fibers can be used to move waves in a prescribed way. They can pick up ultrasound waves along the way and deliver them to a remotely located ultrasound sensor.</p><p>&#x201C;The idea is similar to how a spider finds prey on its web,&#x201D; Huang said. &#x201C;When the prey struggles, it sends vibrations down the strands of web, alerting the spider that the prey is there and its location.</p><p>&#x201C;When a crack happens in a structure, it generates a wave. The ultrasound sensors would detect that wave and pinpoint it based on the dissonance between waveguides.&#x201D;</p><p>Huang&#x2019;s work with ultrasound transducers and waveguides is an example of research in the area of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, said Erian Armanios, chair of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.</p><p>&#x201C;Achieving real-time information on the health of naval and aerospace structures is key to improved safety and performance. Dr. Huang&#x2019;s development of ultrasound transducers reflects her pioneering research in addressing timely challenges in corrosion mitigation and condition-based maintenance for the Navy fleet,&#x201D; Armanios said.</p><div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div><div style=\"text-align: left;\"></div>"

The Lady Movin&#x2019; Mavs have claimed two national championships.</p><p>UTA&#x2019;s start in wheelchair basketball dates back to 1976. Since joining the Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball Division in 1989, 34 UTA Movin&#x2019; Mavs have earned First Team All-American recognition, 28 earned Second Team All-American honors, and nine Movin&#x2019; Mavs have been named MVP.</p><p>Young student athletes from eight countries have studied at UTA and played for the Movin&#x2019; Mavs. More importantly, the graduation rate for the Movin&#x2019; Mavs is extraordinarily high.</p><p>Currently the Movin&apos; Mavs are working to provide additional sport and recreation opportunities for our students with disabilities.&#xA0; See&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/movinmavs/recreation/index.php\">Adaptive Recreation</a>.</p><p>Within the Junior Division, the number of teams tripled from 30 to approximately 90 under his supervision. Garner implemented divisional play among juniors, as well as establishing rules of grade requirements, encouraging young players achieve good grades and graduate high school.</p><p>Garner facilitated skill development by creating camps for juniors, adults and veterans to learn the sport and helped bring the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation classification system to the United States, putting the National Wheelchair Basketball Association in line with other teams and countries in the IWBF, the international governing body for the sport.</p><p>&#x201C;Coach Garner works tirelessly to make sure people with disabilities have the same opportunities in life as anyone else,&#x201D; said Alejandro Pabon, a senior on the Movin&#x2019; Mavs team. &#x201C;He gives so much of himself to help make the world a better place for others.&#x201D;</p><p>On the international level, Garner became an International Wheelchair Basketball Federation certified International Technical Official. With this qualification, he was able to establish the criteria to prepare teams for international play.</p><p>&#x201C;Doug&#x2019;s passion is contagious,&#x201D; said Lisa&#xA0;Nagy, vice president of student affairs. &#x201C;He is a strong advocate of wheelchair basketball and the opportunities it holds for players.&#x201D;</p><p>In the College Division, the Movin&#x2019; Mavs were the first team in the division to livestream their games. Recording both home and away games, Garner was able to archive these games so that friends and family of the players are able to watch them. He also has created training film and posted that on social media to help spread awareness of the sport, as well as young players, coaches and fans around the world could watch the sport.</p><p>&#x201C;Doug has been such a huge part of wheelchair sports in general, helping all ages and disabilities,&#x201D; said James Patin III, a Navy veteran and UTA graduate, who now coaches the Dallas Wheelchair Mavericks. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s really amazing when you think about all that he has accomplished, on top of running a successful college wheelchair basketball program.&#x201D;</p><p>Garner has created camps and clinics for veterans and other injured soldiers to bring wheelchair basketball back on a more consistent basis that helps those veterans to transition to more of a community team after their military service. He also coached the Army Warrior Games team to three gold medals at the annual event.</p><p>&#x201C;I see disability as a growing civil rights movement,&#x201D; Garner said. &#x201C;We have to get past stereotypes and antiquated expectations of disability to an understanding of how our environment&#x2014;including physical, attitude, values and beliefs&#x2014;actually creates the obstacles and road blocks for all people to achieve their full human potential.&#x201D;</p><p align=\"right\"><i>Written by Amanda Augustine</i></p><p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>"

This has the potential to increase patient compliance, which is a huge problem in current rehabilitation approaches. As robot-assisted treatment becomes widely available and accepted, the customer base will grow from acute care clinics to long-term rehabilitation centers and finally to home-based care. This robot-assisted rehabilitation market is expected to grow dramatically, reaching $2 billion by 2020 and we believe our system has a strong niche market opportunity.&#x201D;</p><p>Clinical partners Rita M. Patterson and Nicoleta Bugnariu, professors of family medicine and physical therapy at UNTHSC, have been working with the team for several years. Initial research and design of this rehab glove was through a $99,000 grant from the Texas Medical Research Collaborative.</p><p>&#x201C;Assistive motion provided by the glove enable patients to engage in rehabilitation activities regardless of their impairment levels,&#x201D; Patterson said.</p><p>&#x201C;Gamified rehabilitation activities in virtual environments&#xA0;are based on motor learning principles that drive neuroplasticity and&#xA0;allow achieving rehabilitation goals while creating an enjoyable engagement,&#x201D; Bugnariu said. &#x201C;Patients can engage these rehabilitation activities throughout their rehabilitation continuum.&#x201D;</p><p>Mickey McCabe, UTARI executive director, said the project is a wonderful example of UTARI&#x2019;s drive to develop technologies that can be commercialized in order to improve quality of life.</p><p>&#x201C;This is exactly what the NSF&#x2019;s Small Business Technology Transfer Fund was designed for,&#x201D; McCabe said. &#x201C;This work puts the rehab glove one step closer to the consumer, which is where it belongs.

One species causes tuberculosis, and another causes leprosy.</p><p>Mycobacteria have both a cell wall structure and a mode of growth that are distinct from well-studied model organisms and use several different regulatory mechanisms that are not well understood.</p><p>&#x201C;The rationale behind this research is that knowledge of the signaling events that allow mycobacteria to respond to stress will lead to a better understanding of mycobacterial infection physiology and mechanisms of antibiotic tolerance, which could lead to the development of new anti-mycobacterial drugs,&#x201D; Boutte said.</p><p>The project will promote a better understanding of how mycobacterial pathogens survive during infection stress and antibiotic treatment, Boutte said. The research will characterize two systems by which mycobacteria regulate cell growth and division in response to stress and will describe new mechanisms of cell wall regulation.</p><p>Bacterial cell elongation and division are acutely responsive to stress. This adaptability promotes survival in changeable environments. Changes in growth and division require that the enzymes that build the cell wall are regulated in response to environmental signals. This regulation changes cell wall chemistry, cell size and antibiotic tolerance, but is poorly understood.</p><p>&#x201C;This lack of knowledge about how mycobacterial cells alter their cell wall in stress contributes to the continued failure to design antibiotic regimens that quickly clear mycobacterial infections,&#x201D; Boutte said. &#x201C;We believe the results of our work will illuminate cell wall regulatory mechanisms that are likely to be important for infection and antibiotic tolerance in pathogenic mycobacteria.&#x201D;</p><p>The research furthers UTA&#x2019;s mission to make significant impact in the field of health and the human condition, one of the main pillars of the University&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p><p>&#x201C;This project has important implications for public health because mycobacteria have developed immunity to many kinds of antibiotics,&#x201D; said Clay Clark, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Biology. &#x201C;Dr. Boutte and her students could add significantly to our understanding of how mycobacteria survive antibiotic treatment and help scientists develop more effective treatments.&#x201D;</p><p>Assisting in the project are graduate students Angela Freeman and Neda Habibi and undergraduate students Heather Lake and Susana Pimental, all of whom work in Boutte&#x2019;s lab.</p><p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- Written by Greg Pederson</em></p>"

Their work, <a href=\"https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2019/03/15/gr.240952.118.abstract\">&#x201C;The origins and evolution of chromosomes, dosage compensation, and mechanisms underlying venom regulation in snakes,&#x201D;</a> is published in the April issue of <i>Genome Research</i>, the scientific journal published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.</p><p>UTA co-authors include Drew Schield, Daren Card, Nicole Hales, Blair Perry, Giulia Pasquesi, Richard Adams, and Andrew Corbin, all current or former members of Castoe&#x2019;s lab; doctoral student Balan Ramesh; biology Professor Esther Betr&#xE1;n; and biology Associate Professor Jeffery Demuth. Other co-authors include UTA doctoral graduates Heath Blackmon, Texas A&amp;M University, and Jesse Meik, Tarleton State University.</p><p>The team analyzed the rattlesnake genome to investigate diverse features of vertebrate and snake biology, including the evolution of genome structure, how some chromosomes became sex chromosomes during snake evolution, and how multiple layers of genome organization drive the precise regulation of venom.</p><p>The paper provides the first chromosome-level assembly of a reptile genome, and provides new evidence that microchromosomes present in some vertebrates may functionally interact in the nucleus in unique and previously unknown ways.</p><p>&#x201C;Despite extensive research on snake venom, very little is known about the genomic basis of this extreme adaptation and how venom has evolved over time,&#x201D; Castoe said. &#x201C;While venom is of major interest among snake biologists, the regions of snake genomes that harbor the genes to make venom have been among the most challenging regions of the genome to sequence and assemble accurately.&#x201D;</p><p>By leveraging cutting-edge genome sequencing methods, the team was for the first time able to generate well-assembled snake venom genes. This provided new genomic context for how venom genes have evolved through a process called tandem duplication, leading to discrete clusters of venom genes in the genomic landscape. They also discovered that many venom genes are found on microchromosomes, which are densely packed with genes and have other distinctive features.</p><p>The team also demonstrated that microchromosomes, which are absent in mammals but present in birds and many reptiles, have fundamentally distinct structure and function &#x2013; providing evidence that the genomes of many vertebrates do not necessarily &#x201C;work the same&#x201D; as the genomes of mammals.</p><p>Researchers addressed how snakes are able to secrete venom via the regulation of venom genes exclusively in the venom gland, and not in other organs. They leveraged new cutting-edge sequencing approaches, called Hi-C sequencing, which captures information about interactions between different genomic regions in the nucleus, to analyze how genome organization directs this precise regulation of venom genes.</p><p>They found that venom gene regions are isolated within distinct chromosomal structures called TADs, or topologically associating domains, in venom-secreting cells. These TADs form loops in the genomic DNA to localize the gene regulation machinery specifically to the genes for making venom, leading to a highly precise pattern of gene expression only in the venom gland. This finding provides evidence of a previously unknown mechanism regulating snake venom secretion, and exciting links between genome structure and function.</p><p>While humans and other mammals have X and Y sex chromosomes, the rattlesnake has Z and W sex chromosomes. In ZW systems, males have two Z chromosomes and females have one Z and one W chromosome. Rattlesnake sex chromosomes are highly differentiated and exhibit many distinct characteristics compared to non-sex chromosomes, called autosomes. Highly differentiated sex chromosomes often require mechanisms to equalize gene expression between genetic sexes to ensure proper genome function &#x2013; these are called dosage compensation mechanisms.</p><p>Snakes are especially intriguing because, instead of evolving a mechanism to equalize gene expression across the whole chromosome, as humans do, they have evolved dosage compensation in particular regions and possibly even specific genes on the Z chromosome.</p><p>&#x201C;One of the most exciting features of the rattlesnake genome assembly is that it includes the first complete sex chromosome for a snake,&#x201D; said Schield, lead author on the paper.</p><p>The researchers used the rattlesnake genome to trace the evolution of snake sex chromosomes, and the origins of sex-specific patterns of gene expression on the Z chromosome. They also identified the first genetic mechanism that may underlie snake dosage compensation. These findings establish new genomic context for the evolution of sex determination in snakes and provide new insight into the diversity of sex determination systems in vertebrates.</p><p>Broadly, the findings of the paper focused on the rattlesnake genome highlight the tremendous biological value of quality genome resources for non-model species. The Castoe lab published the very first snake genome &#x2013; the Burmese python genome &#x2013; six years ago, and since then several other snake genome resources have become available. Each snake genome has enabled new discoveries about snake and vertebrate biology.</p><p>With the rattlesnake genome, the caliber of snake genomes is now at the level of quality of many traditional model organisms. Having a diverse array of vertebrate genomes enables broad comparisons to understand fundamental aspects of genome biology. The rattlesnake genome adds to the growing list of species to allow for these comparisons, and also provides unprecedented potential to understand the unique features of snakes.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Castoe and his colleagues have made an important advance in our knowledge of the snake genome at the chromosome level,&#x201D; said Clay Clark, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Biology. &#x201C;Their findings about the genomic basis of venom evolution and snake sex chromosomes are exciting breakthroughs in snake genome research and confirms the Castoe lab&#x2019;s standing as one of the nation&#x2019;s leaders in snake genome research.&#x201D;</p>"

The species is a common group of tropical lizards that are a model system in ecology and evolutionary biology.</p><p>&#x201C;This work uses elevation as a lens to understand the potential implications of climate change,&#x201D; Frishkoff said. &#x201C;Temperature changes along an elevation gradient, and general climate temperatures are expected to continue warming. By comparing the highlands to the lowlands, we can, in some sense, get a picture of how these biological communities might look in the future.&#x201D;</p><p>The lowlands along the gradient are warmer than the highlands due to altitude, and a forest canopy blocks direct sunlight making the vegetation-dense areas cooler than their agricultural surroundings at any elevation. The study determined elevation plays a major role in which species survive as humans modify the habitat.</p><p>&#x201C;The takeaway message is that the lizard communities in the lowlands are pretty good at coping with habitat conversion&#x2014;they lose abundance, but don&#x2019;t go extinct,&#x201D; Frishkoff said. &#x201C;When the forest is cut down in the highlands and the habitat warms, the pastures become filled with species from the warmer lowlands. Unlike the lowland species, the locally adapted forest lizards unique to the region&#x2019;s mountaintops cannot survive when the forest is cut down.&#x201D;</p><p>Frishkoff points out that biodiverse animals in any habitat act as &#x201C;ecological players&#x201D; to balance the ecosystem and often provide services that benefit humans in a variety of different ways. In order to get the most benefit from these ecological players, humans need to understand and have mechanisms to predict which species will survive as the climate warms and human land use changes, and Frishkoff&#x2019;s research indicates the effects of habitat conversion can change radically with elevation.</p><p>The Dominican Republic study is part of a larger project, Frishkoff said. Since coming to UTA in September 2018, he has begun looking at lizard populations throughout Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Central America and Texas to understand the rules that govern species survival in a variety of different climates and conditions.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;We need to be able to predict what species are going to do well in what environmental contexts,&#x201D; Frishkoff said. &#x201C;The broader goal is to lay that foundation to predict biological communities across climates, across land uses. So that eventually policymakers can use that information eventually to make decisions that integrate human wellbeing and biological wellbeing.&#x201D;</p><p>In his research, Frishkoff focuses mainly on reptiles and amphibians. He said the placement of UTA offers a great wealth of biological diversity to support his research, which is enriched by the university&#x2019;s Amphibian and Reptile Diversity Research Center. The ARDRC is home to the largest herpetology collection in Texas with more than 200,000 specimens.</p><p>Using the collection, Frishkoff&#x2019;s lab is beginning to study morphological differences between species to understand whether certain body shapes allow various species to do better in urban environments like the one UTA lies at the center of.</p><p>&#x201C;Luke&#x2019;s ongoing and developing research endeavors to address critical issues facing our global environment and support a sustainable urban community &#x2013; two driving themes of our university&#x2019;s strategic plan,&#x201D; said Clay Clark, professor and chair of the Department of Biology. &#x201C;He will make great contributions to our growing footprint as a research enterprise.&#x201D;</p>"

Specifically, researchers are trying to achieve the least amount of energy consumption necessary to transmit information optically per bit.</p><p>&#x201C;By looking at the processes involved in carrier dynamics, we can look into ways to improve speed by using different materials or changing the structure of the laser cavity,&#x201D; Zhou said. &#x201C;Our goal is to eventually understand and demonstrate new laser structures that will be better than the current state-of-the-art.&#x201D;</p><p>The new structures could allow scaling of lasers to nanometer sizes. Potential applications for the technology include data networking, flexible displays, solid-state lighting, energy harvesting, infrared night vision and image and gas sensing for medical, biological, environmental, military and homeland security uses.&#xA0;</p><p>Zhou has received several other grants in the area of photonics, including a five-year, $3 million Multidisciplinary Research Initiatives grant from the High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office in 2017 to develop a high-power semiconductor laser that is compact, efficient and power-scalable. Since joining UTA in 2004, his Nanophotonics Group has received more than $10 million in research grants.</p><p>His latest award is an example of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, said Peter Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering.</p><p>&#x201C;Advances in photonics hold tremendous promise for scientific and technological discovery.

Both companies are at the forefront of innovative and sustainable technology within the manufacturing industry.</p><p>The tours provided a glimpse of different approaches to the idea of composite building assemblies. Factory Blue highlighted a step-by-step building approach to interior components driving advanced manufacturing. Zahner displayed how layered assembly building facades are produced with performance driving the design and fabrication.</p><p>The symposium included directors of manufacturing facilities, designers of labs and firms and academic leaders. Two of the speakers, Bill Kreysler, president of Kreysler &amp; Associates, and Bill Zahner, CEO of Zahner, are foremost experts in the field of composite and metal advanced manufacturing.</p><p>&#x201C;Their work is known internationally and has pioneered the way buildings are designed and constructed,&#x201D; Bell said.</p><p>The discussion emphasized the importance of sustainability in the future of design. As technical innovation is integrated, productivity increases and advanced manufacturing establishes a sustainable framework. This allows a more efficient process, including less building waste, higher thermal importance and improved life-cycle costs of material.</p><p>The symposium participants also examined various scales of advanced manufacturing, ranging from designed public art to repetitive parts of high-rise buildings. Within the realm of architecture and the built environment, the capability to produce larger or more complex pieces and parts of buildings has increased to the point that questions of scale, tolerance, information control, ownership and craft also must be considered in different ways.</p><p>&quot;I am excited to have such a prestigious group of thought-leaders together at one time sharing their vision on how digital technologies will revolutionize the design and fabrication of the built environment,&#x201D; Bell said. &#x201C;We are at a pivotal time where large problems will demand bold solutions.&#x201D;</p><p>&#xA0;</p><p align=\"right\">--&#xA0;&#xA0;<i>Written by Caroline Stultz</i></p><p align=\"right\" style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>"

If a student comes into school with little idea of what they want to do, it can lead to wasted time and more money spent.&#x201D;</p><p>Teresa Taber Doughty, dean of the College of Education, noted that the University &#x201C;has committed to programs and initiatives that support PK-16 education in Texas. We focus on preparing highly effective teachers, school leaders and higher education administrators as our faculty engage in impactful research that shapes education-related policies and practices.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Drs. Zhang and Trache commit tremendous time and effort to research that will ensure our practices and the state&#x2019;s education policy serve students,&#x201D; she continued. &#x201C;Their research examining student outcomes achieved through the FHSP will result in findings that will inform our future practices. I continue to be impressed by the work in which Drs. Zhang and Trache are engaged and am excited to see how these Mavericks continue to shape the landscape of education in Texas.&#x201D;</p><p>Zhang and Trache are analyzing data from a cohort of more than 400,000 students. The funding from the Greater Texas Foundation supports four years of study. This study is a continuation of a one-year project sponsored by <a href=\"https://texasoncourse.org/\">Texas OnCourse</a> the two conducted previously. The researchers say the new funding will allow them to study the educational experience of the cohort from the time they selected their endorsements to anticipated college graduation.</p>"

He is also a <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2017/04/garrigus-nhcfellow.php\">2017-18 fellow of the prestigious National Humanities Center</a>.<br> <br> The Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program recipients each receive a grant of up to $200,000, making it possible for them to devote significant time to research, writing and publishing in the humanities and social sciences.</p><p>&#x201C;It is humbling. And it&#x2019;s a recognition of what The University of Texas at Arlington has become,&#x201D; Garrigus said. &#x201C;I would not have been considered for this award before we received the R-1 Carnegie designation.&#x201D;</p><p>UTA first received R-1: Doctoral Universities&#x2014;Very High Research Activity status in 2016 from Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. It is the definitive list for the top doctoral research universities in the United States.</p><p>During his fellowship, Garrigus plans to continue his lifelong work on slave life in the Caribbean. Much of his research has centered on Francois Macandal, a Haitian burned at the stake by French planters who believed he had fatally poisoned thousands of slaves, hundreds of colonists and countless livestock.</p><p>Garrigus&#x2019; book project&#x2014;&#x201C;Macandal is Saved&#x201D;: Disease, Conspiracy, and the Coming of the Haitian Revolution&#x2014;proves that a generation before Haiti&#x2019;s successful slave revolution, the French colony was decimated not by rebel slaves wielding poison, but by anthrax spores transported from France in a shipment of mules.</p><p>Garrigus believes his research on the Macandal affair will change the way people think about the Haitian Revolution that ended slavery there 45 years later.</p><p>&#x201C;I think everyone who lives in a democracy owes a debt of gratitude to the Haitian revolutionaries,&#x201D; Garrigus said. &#x201C;Twenty years ago, we didn&#x2019;t understand that. But we&#x2019;re learning more and more. With this award, I&#x2019;ll have the time to write a general audience book about this fascinating episode.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Professor Garrigus&#x2019; scholarship is shedding new light on Haitian history and the effects of French colonization. His exacting research is ensuring a better understanding of the revolution and of aspects related to the human condition. I&#x2019;m thrilled that his scholarship has been recognized through a 2019 Andrew Carnegie Fellowship,&#x201D; said President Vistasp Karbhari. &#x201C;Professor Garrigus exemplifies the highest levels of excellence that define our faculty in the College of Liberal Arts and at The University of Texas at Arlington. Our students gain significantly from his brilliance in the classroom and as they initiate their own research.&#x201D;</p><p>The 2019 class of the Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program includes recipients from leading institutions across the United States, including MIT, Columbia, Georgetown, Harvard, Yale, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Vanderbilt and Northwestern.</p><p>Elisabeth Cawthon, dean of the College of Liberal Arts, said the University is stronger because of contributions from faculty members such as Garrigus.</p><p>&#x201C;John&#x2019;s love of Caribbean history shows in his research and in the classes he teaches,&#x201D; Cawthon said. &#x201C;And now the Carnegie Corporation of New York has chosen to select John&#x2019;s work to reward. What an honor. Being singled out by the Carnegie Corporation of New York is no small feat.&#x201D;</p><p>The overall objective of the Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program is to offer fresh perspectives on the humanities and solutions to the urgent issues of today.</p><p>The award is for a period of up to two years and its anticipated result is a book or major study. The program is the most generous initiative of its kind, providing $32 million in grants to more than 160 fellows since 2015, according to the Carnegie Corporation of New York.</p><p>&#x201C;Andrew Carnegie believed in education and understood its influence on the progress of society and mankind. The Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program is an integral part of carrying out the mission he set for our organization,&#x201D; said Vartan Gregorian, president of Carnegie Corporation of New York and president emeritus of Brown University. &#x201C;Over the past five years, we at Carnegie have been very impressed by the quality, range and reach of our fellows&#x2019; work. This year is no exception. We salute this year&#x2019;s class and all of the applicants for demonstrating the vitality of American higher education and scholarship.&#x201D;</p><p>For 2019, the Carnegie Corporation of New York received a total of 273 nominations. Each underwent a preliminary anonymous evaluation by national experts from relevant fields. The top proposals were forwarded to a distinguished panel of 16 jurors, who chose the fellows based on the quality, originality and potential impact of their proposals, as well as each scholar&#x2019;s capacity to communicate the findings to a broad audience. The jurors are all scholars and intellectual leaders from some of the world&#x2019;s leading educational institutions, foundations and scholarly societies, and six are either current or former university presidents.</p><p>The Andrew Carnegie Fellows Program is a continuation of the corporation&apos;s more than 100- year history of promoting the advancement and diffusion of knowledge and understanding by supporting the work of a host of institutions, causes, organizations and individual scholars. Each year as part of the nominating process, the heads of more than 600 institutions, representing universities, think tanks, publishers and nonprofit organizations nationwide, are invited to nominate up to two individuals each for the fellowships.</p><p>Garrigus, who came to UTA in 2006, was awarded the 2007 Gilbert Chinard Prize sponsored by the Society for French Historical Studies. He previously served as a professor at Jacksonville University and as a visiting Fulbright professor at the State University of Haiti.&#xA0; He earned a Bachelor of Arts in history from DePauw University and both a Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy in history from The Johns Hopkins University.</p>"

It also will allow more collaborations across the full spectrum of naval technology.</p><p>The agreement is UTA&#x2019;s second with a Naval Surface Warfare Center. The University signed an Educational Partnership Agreement with Naval Surface Warfare Center Philadelphia Division, or NSWCPD, in October 2018.</p><p>David Wetz, an electrical engineering professor and the College of Engineering&#x2019;s director of Strategic Initiatives, was instrumental in creating both partnerships. He specializes in energy storage and pulsed power system design and has been involved in extensive collaborative research projects with the Navy in these research areas since 2006.</p><p>&#x201C;Both of these agreements have resulted from UTA&#x2019;s long history of obtaining grant funding from the Office of Naval Research for projects that directly support ongoing efforts at NSWCDD and NSWCPD, respectively. Researchers at Dahlgren are interested in identifying additional research areas that our Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering departments, respectively, can collaborate with them on and we are so grateful for them recognizing the potential impact our faculty and students offer. Ideally, this is a college-wide opportunity that will benefit everyone involved,&#x201D; Wetz said.</p><p>Wetz received an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Award and has been an ONR Summer Faculty Fellow at the NWSCPD for several summers. Many of his students have obtained summer student fellowships since 2014 at NSWCDD, NSWCPD and the Naval Surface Warfare Center Darderock Division, respectively, through the Naval Research Enterprise Internship Program.</p><p>&#x201C;I am very pleased that our relationship with the Navy has expanded. This will strengthen our research and bring new opportunities for research to our Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering Departments. Also, our students will have even greater opportunities to work with advanced technologies before they enter the workforce,&#x201D; said Peter Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering.</p><p>NSWCDD provides research, development, test and evaluation, analysis, systems engineering, integration and certification of complex naval warfare systems. Technology developed at Dahlgren is critical to new design concepts for current ships and for systems integration and interoperability for the U.S. Navy.&#xA0;The division also conducts basic research in all systems-related areas and pursues scientific disciplines including physics; mathematics; laser and computer technology; software, mechanical, electrical and systems engineering; biotechnology; and chemistry.&#xA0;</p><p>The Educational Partnership Agreement is an example of UTA&#x2019;s commitment to transforming the student experience by enhancing access and ensuring success, engaging in high-impact research and scholarship and strengthening collaboration with corporate and nonprofit sectors, as outlined in UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact, said Duane Dimos, the University&#x2019;s vice president for research.</p><p>&#x201C;We are thrilled to be involved with NSWCDD. We have long been a partner with the Navy and these agreements underscore our desire&#x2014;and theirs&#x2014;to provide greater educational opportunities for our faculty and students.

Caspases evolved from a common ancestor into two distinct subfamilies.</p><p>Though little is known about the regulation of these proteins, scientist have learned that they are regulated differently in different organisms.</p><p>&#x201C;If humans have a certain sequence in their caspase proteins, and fish have a similar but slightly different sequence, then we can reconstruct the common ancestor through the use of various computational methods,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;We actually resurrect these extinct proteins so we can track how cell death regulations have changed over time to gain insight into the processes.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Clark&#x2019;s research has the potential to transform how we understand and potentially treat a variety of health issues, such as cancer,&#x201D; College of Science Dean Morteza Khaledi said. &#x201C;I congratulate him on the significant funding he has received from the National Institutes of Health to pursue this important set of research questions.&#x201D;</p><p>Clark has dedicated more than 20 years to studying the structure and function of cellular proteins. With his background in both biology and biochemistry, he will blend the two disciplines in the current NIH-funded study.</p><p>&#x201C;As a biochemist, I approach this with attention to how these regulating proteins work. With my background in biology, I&#x2019;m interested in how they work in cells, not just test tubes,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s been a theme throughout my career.

        "body": "<p>The most decorated university racing team in the United States began its quest for a ninth Formula SAE championship with an unveiling of its 2019 car.</p><p>The University of Texas at Arlington has won eight championships in the U.S. and international titles in Great Britain, Australia and Japan in 38 years of competition. Team manager Anirudh Markkassery is confident that this year&#x2019;s car could take the top spot at the Formula SAE competition in Lincoln, Neb., June 19-22.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/uta-racing-profile.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>&#x201C;I think this car will be a No. 1 contender. We have a solid team, and this could be our next champion,&#x201D; Markkassery said.</p><p>Each year&#x2019;s car is a brand-new design, built from the wheels up. This year&#x2019;s model, under the direction of team captain Chris Dunn, chief engineer Scott Berggren and longtime FSAE adviser and mechanical engineering Professor Bob Woods, was finished in March, giving the engineers and drivers three months to test all of the systems and learn the car&#x2019;s intricacies on the track.</p><p>The extra time for testing is important because major problems can be identified and fixed before the competition. Driver training is also crucial, as being able to drive the actual competition car gives the drivers a better understanding of the car&#x2019;s tendencies and limitations, such as how it will handle in turns and how the brakes will respond.</p><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m really excited about this car,&#x201D; said Woods.&#xA0;&#x201C;We have returned to some design features that have been proven in the past and added new features that should make it really competitive.&#xA0;It was finished early enough to allow this unveiling, plus a lot of track testing and a wind tunnel test.&#xA0;We have high expectations for this car in the U.S. and Australia.&#x201D;</p><p>The team is composed completely of students, mostly from the College of Engineering, but open to all majors. There are about 25 full members and 15 associate members, each assigned to one of nine groups: aerodynamics, composites, drivetrain, electrical, engine, suspension, chassis, ergonomics and data acquisition. Members also generate corporate sponsorships to underwrite the costs of the materials.</p><p>&#x201C;The real-world applications of being part of this team can&#x2019;t be beat,&#x201D; said Dunn. &#x201C;We come up with our concept and decide on our parameters, design the car in CAD and at the end of the year we have a car with amazing technology. You can&#x2019;t get much more &#x2018;real-world&#x2019; than that.&#x201D;</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption450\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/uta-racing-front.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>The car weighs less than 460 pounds. It can accelerate from 0-60 in fewer than three seconds and generates three Gs of lateral force through turns. Over the years, UTA has developed revolutionary designs in engines and fuel injection, as well as an active aerodynamic system with wings in four quadrants that can be adjusted by the driver via an onboard computer to provide optimal downforce for greater handling. The 1992 car featured the first carbon fiber composite wheels in Formula SAE history.</p><p>This year, the car was simplified and designed to reduce manufacturing time, but there are still several engineering changes.&#xA0;</p><p>&#x201C;We simplified the car, but still made engineering changes to improve handling and performance,&#x201D; Berggren said. &#x201C;We used unsprung aerodynamics, which keeps downforces from compressing the springs, so the front wing moves more favorably during lateral Gs or when the car hits a bump. We improved the efficiency of the front wing because it does more for performance than the other systems on the car. We really invested time in ergonomics to hold the driver in place and make driver inputs easier so the driver is more comfortable and the car is easier to drive.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p><p>UTA began FSAE competition in the Mini Baja class in 1981 and won championships that year and in 1982. The first championship in the Formula class came in 1985, and the team also racked up victories in 1986, 1990, 1991, 1995 and 1996. In addition, the team won the inaugural Formula Student competition in England in 1998, Formula SAE Australasia in Australia in 2000 and Formula SAE Japan in 2004.</p><p>In 2012, a $1 million endowment by Arlington businessman Arnold E. Petsche, matched through the University&#x2019;s Maverick Match program, established the Arnold E. Petsche Center for Automotive Engineering, which is located on the first floor of Woolf Hall and houses a showroom for several of the team&#x2019;s cars, plus meeting and work spaces.</p><p>In 2014, UTA was ranked No. 5 in the world and No. 1 in the United States in the Formula Student Combustion World Rankings.</p><p>&#x201C;Our racing teams have shown a consistent level of excellence for more than three decades, and they have been leaders in innovation the entire time,&#x201D; said Peter Crouch, dean of the College of Engineering. &#x201C;Their contributions to Formula SAE, in particular the guidance of Bob Woods, are unmatched, and the experience gained by students during their time with the team positions them to be top candidates with industry-leading companies worldwide.&#x201D;</p>"

The MTEC agreement, awarded in October 2017, funded the development of this low volume manufacturing process, which has created 100 flexible polymeric gloves for early stage clinical trials.</p><p>The success of the project earned UTA the MTEC Prototype of the Year Acceleration Award (under $1 million) at the consortium&#x2019;s fourth annual membership meeting in March. The award is given to the project that effectively advances a novel prototype technology to its next major milestone in a 12-month period.</p><p>The REHEAL Glove is a flexible glove wound dressing for treatment after hand trauma that provides commonly used negative pressure wound therapy. It also allows early motion therapy during healing to reduce scarring that prevents irreversible joint stiffness.</p><p>Additionally, the glove provides a means for delivering therapeutics and controlling the wound environment for better and faster healing. The REHEAL Glove can be easily applied and removed, and does not adhere to the wound, which minimizes pain during dressing removal. The material of the glove is made of transparent silicone, enabling for continuous monitoring of the wound.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/mtec-awards-ceremony.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>President and Chairman of MTEC Lester Martinez Lopez (left) and MTEC Chief Operating Officer William Howell (right) present UTA&apos;s Muthu Wijensundara (center) with the MTEC Prototype of the Year Acceleration Award for the REHEAL Glove.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Muthu Wijesundara, head of the Biomedical Technologies Division at UTARI and leader of the project, said the development of the manufacturing process established consistency throughout production and poises the glove for transition into clinical trials.</p><p>&#x201C;The manufacturing process gives us more reliability and uniformity in the REHEAL Glove production,&#x201D; Wijesundara said. &#x201C;Having this process reduces the risk of variants among the gloves interfering with any future clinical trial work.&#x201D;</p><p>Mickey McCabe, executive director of UTARI, said the award builds UTA&#x2019;s reputation among the federal research community as an effective, efficient institute for advancing research ideas to practical implementation while improving health and the human condition.</p><p>&#x201C;The MTEC award is a recognition that UTA and UTARI have the expertise and resources necessary to take on time-sensitive, goal-oriented projects,&#x201D; McCabe said. &#x201C;This award also builds on a long history of successful delivery of research results and intellectual property to companies and all branches of our nation&#x2019;s military.&#x201D;</p><p>MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10-year renewable Other Transaction Agreement with the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. The consortium focuses on the development of medical solutions that protect and heal those that serve.</p><p>&#x201C;Complex hand wounds can be debilitating, and current therapies often lead to excessive scar formation and fail to preserve range of motion,&#x201D; said Lauren Palestrini, MTEC director of research programs. &#x201C;I believe that the REHEAL Glove addresses many of these limitations and hope its utilization will improve treatment of these injuries. The team, led by Dr. Wijesundara, has done a great job developing a process for low volume production.</p><p>&#x201C;The completion of this work is critical in helping the team move forward with testing this hand wound care-dressing system in early feasibility studies and subsequent clinical trials. We are proud to support the work of the team at UTARI as they advance this game-changing technology.&#x201D;</p><p>The project was borne from a collaboration between Wijesundara and Christopher Allan, associate professor of orthopedics and sports medicine at the University of Washington. Allan acts as the clinical partner, while Wijesundara and UTARI provide the engineering support.</p><p>&#x201C;The forward momentum of the REHEAL Glove project is an outstanding demonstration of UTARI&#x2019;s mission to link laboratory discoveries to commercialization that ultimately benefits society,&#x201D; UTA Vice President for Research Duane Dimos said. &#x201C;I am proud to know this level of cutting-edge research and development is taking place at our University. Thank you to Dr. Wijesundara and his team for their commitment to a project that will serve to improve the treatment and prognosis of serious hand injuries.&#x201D;</p>"

She is the first UTA student to receive this prestigious award.</p><p>&#x201C;This award gives me my first taste of independent success as a researcher,&#x201D; Kuriakose said. &#x201C;Being able to work with my own funding gives me confidence and a sense of what it will be like to act as a principal investigator throughout my career.&#x201D;</p><p>Kuriakose is a research assistant for Kytai Nguyen, professor of bioengineering, whose lab is investigating a new method for treating peripheral artery disease, a circulatory condition in which narrowed blood vessels reduce blood flow to the limbs, causing chronic pain, numbness or weakness.</p><p>The method involves combining the balloon devices used during angioplasty procedures with therapeutic nanomedicine to treat the blood vessels without leaving behind foreign objects, such as a stent. Such objects can lead to thrombosis and other complications.</p><p>Kuriakose said she hopes her work will expand currently limited treatment options for patients with peripheral artery disease and that the method will someday have applications for other cardiovascular diseases and injuries.</p><p>&#x201C;Not many people are given the opportunity I&#x2019;ve received with this fellowship,&#x201D; Kuriakose said. &#x201C;I am grateful to Dr. Nguyen for encouraging me and her other students to write our own proposals and pursue our own grant funding. She spent a great deal of time with me throughout this process to ensure I had what I needed to be successful.&#x201D;</p><p>It was Nguyen&#x2019;s research portfolio in tissue engineering and hands-on, supportive method of mentorship that interested Kuriakose when she first had the opportunity to work with the professor while completing the dual <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/biology/undergraduate-study/dual-bs-ms-degree.php\">Biology/Biomedical Engineering Degree Program</a> at UTA.</p><p>&#x201C;Aneetta is a hard-working doctoral student who attends to her studies while remaining persistent in achieving her career goals,&#x201D; Nguyen said. &#x201C;She demonstrated remarkable independence and tenacity as she wrote this fellowship proposal. After a few rounds of rejection, she continued to pursue this NIH award, whereas many researchers might have given up.</p><p>&#x201C;I have told my students they should look up to Aneetta as a role model in our department. She is a great scientist and student, while balancing being a mother to a young son. Aneetta shows us all that we should not let challenges or distractions deter us from reaching our higher education and career goals.&#x201D;</p><p>While Nguyen praises Kuriakose for her independence, Kuriakose insists the support of the Department of Bioengineering faculty and staff was essential.</p><p>&#x201C;Dr. Nguyen and the faculty and staff in the Bioengineering Department are incredibly supportive,&#x201D; Kuriakose said. &#x201C;This department is very strong and continues to improve. The faculty have incorporated tools that give students hands-on experience while helping them discover what interests them within the field.&#x201D;</p><p>Michael Cho, professor and chair of the UTA Department of Bioengineering, praised Kuriakose for her strong work ethic and said her accomplishment shows that UTA&#x2019;s bioengineering students are highly competitive within the national research and bioengineering communities.</p><p>&#x201C;It shows her fellow graduate students that, with great commitment and work ethic, it is possible to achieve and win major awards that will lay the foundation for future career success,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Cho added that it was a goal of his to elevate bioengineering students to succeed on a national level when he became department chair in 2015. Additionally, he encouraged the department&#x2019;s faculty to compete for grants that would fund the studies of graduate students.</p><p>As another example, <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/bioengineering/student-news/2019/bioengineering-undergrad-nabs-nih-internship.php\">Kristofor Pas</a>, undergraduate biomedical engineering major, was one of just 16 students in the nation selected for the NIH-sponsored Biomedical Engineering Summer Internship Program.</p><p>The Department of Bioengineering has 54 doctoral candidates, including Kuriakose, all of whom are financially supported by various funding mechanisms, including research grant awards. The joint biomedical engineering program with UT Southwestern Medical Center has served North Texas for more than 40 years, with research strengths in bioinstrumentation, biomaterials and tissue engineering, biomechanics, medical imaging and nanomedicine/nanotechnology.</p><p>In 2017, the department won a&#xA0;NIH T-32 grant to subsidize and train doctoral students in health care applications for nanotechnology, specifically to develop tools to battle cardiovascular and pulmonary ailments.</p>"

Lim said over 50 new faculty with experience both directly or indirectly supporting health and the human condition have been hired across every college at UTA since fall 2017.</p><p>Jon Weidanz, associate vice president for research, discussed five key areas related to health and the human condition in which the University is conducting impactful research: cardiovascular health, healthy aging, tissue engineering and biomaterials for cancer research, brain health and host defenses and inflammation.</p><p>&#x201C;Our research expenditures have grown 30% in three years, which can largely be credited to our development of a broad research portfolio,&#x201D; Weidanz said. &#x201C;And we&#x2019;ve made the commitment to recruit additional faculty who will accelerate our progress related to health and the human condition.&#x201D;</p><p>Weidanz highlighted the newly established <a href=\"https://northtexasgenomecenter.com/\">North Texas Genome Center</a> as an example of UTA&#x2019;s leading expertise in health-related research and said its creation is a foundational piece in the University&#x2019;s move into precision health research.</p><p>In an update on the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, Dean Elizabeth Merwin said the college has faculty and students doing work across the entire spectrum of keeping people healthy. Their work has been advanced by a growing research infrastructure at UTA, she said, including the newly constructed Science &amp; Engineering Innovation &amp; Research building.</p><p>Merwin said CONHI is focused on making a difference in the lives of people, and that involves translating research into academic programs.</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s important we integrate our scientific findings and evidence into our educational programs,&#x201D; Merwin said. &#x201C;Our programs should be innovative, serve our communities and equip our students with relevant skills.&#x201D;</p><p>The second half of the two-hour event was dedicated to a number of faculty from across UTA sharing their areas of interest focused on health and the human condition and how they hope to collaborate with colleagues.</p><p>Doug Garner, coach of the <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/movinmavs/index.php\">Movin&#x2019; Mavs</a> wheelchair basketball teams, was in attendance and emphasized the importance of addressing and developing a deeper understanding of issues related to disabilities as an important facet in exploring health and the human condition. Garner closed with an offer to help connect faculty with potential industry partners.</p><p>In his closing remarks, Karbhari emphasized that he wants to hear from faculty about ways the University could help continue such discussions, enable the sharing of ideas and research results, encourage partnerships between faculty members and further facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration.</p><p>Watch a complete video of the symposium <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/331322010\">here</a>. Registration for the May 8 symposium on data-driven discovery is <a href=\"https://events.uta.edu/event/symposium_on_data_driven_discovery#.XL3-79h7nRY\">now open</a>.</p>"

He was 97.</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/nedderman-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Wendell Nedderman served as president of UTA for two decades.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>As the leader of UTA from 1972-92, Nedderman was a tireless advocate for the University and its students who frequently spoke of UTA as a &#x201C;positive-slope institution.&#x201D; It reflected his belief that everything about the University&#x2014;including its enrollment, funding, graduation rates, degree programs and overall growth and stature&#x2014;was on a permanent upward trajectory.</p><p>&#x201C;Someday, we&#x2019;re going to be so darn big and so darn good, we can&#x2019;t be ignored,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Nedderman was the founding dean of the College of Engineering, arriving on campus in 1959 convinced that what was then Arlington State College was destined to grow, given its location between Dallas and Fort Worth. After a decade under his leadership, the engineering college became one of the largest and best in the Southwest.</p><p>In the late 1960s, he served in a number of key positions, sometimes simultaneously. He was dean of engineering (1959-69), vice president for research and graduate affairs (1967-68), graduate school administrator (1967-69) and vice president for academic affairs (1968-72). In 1972 he became acting president, and in 1974, president.</p><p>During his two-decade tenure as president of UTA, enrollment increased from approximately 14,000 students to more than 25,000, including a four-fold increase in graduate students. As president, Nedderman oversaw the construction of or major additions to more than 20 buildings, while adding approximately 60 bachelor&#x2019;s, master&#x2019;s and doctoral degree programs.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/nedderman-laura-and-wendell-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Wendell Nedderman and his granddaughter, Laura, who graduated from the UTA College of Engineering in 2017.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Under his leadership, UTA added the School of Nursing and the School of Architecture and Environmental Design, now known as the College of Nursing and Health Innovation and the College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs. In 1987, he helped establish what today is known as the University of Texas at Arlington Research Institute on 18 acres along the Trinity River in east Fort Worth.</p><p>He also oversaw the project to lower Cooper Street, adding pedestrian bridges over the busy roadway to better connect the east and west sides of campus and improve safety for students.</p><p>&#x201C;I have had a unique experience&#x2026;to participate and observe in the evolution of UTA,&#x201D; he said in 2016.&#xA0;</p><p>UTA President Vistasp Karbhari said that Nedderman set the foundation and trajectory for the transition from a small college to one of the largest and best-reputed universities in Texas.<br> <br> &#x201C;President Nedderman was an inspirational leader, far ahead of his times in his vision for the University of Texas at Arlington, and his passion and dedication to excellence and student success set the standard and bar high for all those who follow him,&#x201D; Karbhari said. &#x201C;Our University is where it is today&#x2014;a national powerhouse and a leader in teaching, research and outreach&#x2014;because of the path that he set and the battles he fought for UTA. His legacy will be felt for years to come and he will always be remembered as a Giant among University leaders.</p><p>&#x201C;Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and all those who held him in their hearts. Lisa and I were honored and privileged to have known him and will always remember his graciousness, his kindness, constant support and encouragement. Rest in peace, President Nedderman&#x2014;your work and legacy lives on in the hearts of the thousands whose lives you touched, the success you enabled in others and in the University you built.&#x201D;</p><p>State Sen. Royce West of Dallas said Nedderman was a crucial figure in UTA&#x2019;s history.</p><p>&#x201C;President Nedderman was a transformative leader for UTA and a mentor, advisor and friend to many of its students,&#x201D; said West, a UTA alumnus. &#x201C;I count myself fortunate to have had our paths cross.&#x201D;</p><p>Nedderman often referred to himself as &#x201C;an old country boy&#x201D; from rural Iowa whose father raised Hereford cattle, hogs and sheep. His own experiences as an Iowa farm boy turned doctoral student transformed him into a lifelong champion for improving access to a college education for tens of thousands of students, especially for transfer and first-generation college students.</p><p>He famously toured the campus in a wheelchair to experience first-hand the accessibility challenges faced by students with mobility issues. It was more than a publicity stunt. It led to significant modifications across UTA and an award from Texas Gov. Dolph Briscoe Jr. in recognition of UTA&#x2019;s efforts to improve campus accessibility for people with disabilities.</p><p>&#x201C;I think there was always an atmosphere of acceptability or friendship or support on the campus of The University of Texas at Arlington,&#x201D; Nedderman said in a 2014 interview. &#x201C;I always took pride in that.&#x201D;</p><figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt=\"nedderman\" id=\"story-image-4\" src=\"/news/images/nedderman-wendell.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Nedderman was known for his gentle touch. For his first 17 years as president, he didn&#x2019;t have a reserved parking space, eventually acquiescing to an advisor who insisted the president have a designated spot. He once told incoming UTA students that their time in college should be spent learning, expanding their intellectual horizons, maintaining physical fitness, developing social skills, building friendships and, lastly, having fun.</p><p>&#x201C;And please notice the order of my suggestions,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Throughout his career, Nedderman championed the city of Arlington, and UTA&#x2019;s role as both an asset and resource for the North Texas region.</p><p>&#x201C;One of our greatest attributes is our strategic location in the heart of a booming Metroplex,&#x201D; he said in 1980. &#x201C;We are accessible to people. We regard the great community around us as our laboratory&#x2014;something to be interacted with, something to add relevance to our academic efforts; something to serve and something to draw strength from.&#x201D;</p><p>Nedderman received numerous awards throughout his career, including Engineer of the Year from the Fort Worth chapter of the Texas Society of Professional Engineers; Citation for Service from the Arlington Chamber of Commerce; Service to People Award, Texas section, from the American Society of Civil Engineers; and Distinguished Honorary Alumnus from the UTA Alumni Association.</p><p>He served on many boards, including the Arlington Independent School District, Arlington Memorial Hospital, Arlington Chamber of Commerce and the Texas Council on Economic Education. He also served as president of the Metropolitan Tarrant County United Way, the Arlington Kiwanis Club and the North Texas Higher Education Authority.</p><p>Nedderman was born Oct. 31, 1921, near Lovilia, Iowa. The man who would help build one of the largest universities in Texas began his education as a boy in a one-room schoolhouse. He eventually graduated first in his high school class and enrolled in Iowa State University&#x2019;s civil engineering program.</p><p>Nedderman attended college on what he says was a &#x201C;shoestring budget,&#x201D; but he was determined to finish and, he said, &#x201C;willing to do anything that it took to get away from the farm and graduate from Iowa State (University).&#x201D;</p><p>He did so in 1943 in the middle of World War II and then promptly joined the Navy Reserve. As a commissioned officer aboard the destroyer USS Patterson, he earned eight battle stars and three campaign ribbons. Before he was 23, Nedderman had fought in the Marianas, the Philippines and at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.</p><p>After the war, he moved to College Station, Texas, where he became an instructor in civil engineering. He also met Betty (Vezey) Nedderman and married her in 1947, a union that lasted 67 years until her death in 2015.</p><p>He earned a master&#x2019;s of civil engineering from Texas A&amp;M in 1949. The couple briefly moved back to Iowa, where Nedderman earned his PhD in civil engineering from Iowa State in 1951.</p><p>Back at Texas A&amp;M, he rose to the rank of professor before being recruited to become the founding dean of engineering at Arlington State College in 1959. Its first day as a four-year college coincided with his arrival as dean of engineering, he recounted in a 2013 interview. For the next decade, Nedderman helped grow the engineering school into one of the Southwest&#x2019;s best, before becoming president.</p><p>In 1992, he was named president emeritus and received the Mirabeau B. Lamar Award for leadership in learning by the Association of Texas Colleges and Universities. He also continued teaching in the College of Engineering.</p><p>In a 2007 interview, Nedderman said the hallmark of his presidency was a philosophy of pride and optimism.</p><p>&#x201C;You have this diverse group of alumni, legislators, regents, faculty, staff, students, all sometimes tugging in different directions,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;You have to pull them all together with a feeling of great pride in your university. And I think there is no substitute for taking pride in your university and exhibiting great enthusiasm.&#x201D;</p><p>Nedderman retired to Frisco, Texas, where he lived with his son Eric and his family. His wife, Betty, preceded him in death. The couple had four children and many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p>"

The <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2019/04/Health-human-condition-symposium.php\">penultimate event</a>, hosted in April, was dedicated to discussions on health and the human condition.</p><p>Thirty-six faculty members with experience and research supporting data-driven discovery have been brought on board since fall 2017 to strengthen the expertise already present at UTA, Provost Teik C. Lim said. The University boasts a <a href=\"https://uta.box.com/s/ljcb00lrp4xnzmiismvht1y49bzaatf3\">diverse collection of researchers</a> utilizing data-driven discovery to deliver powerful benefits that advance technology and the prosperity of society.</p><p>&#x201C;There are large amounts of data being collected across disciplines and industries, so we need to look at how to use this data in a way that is meaningful and has positive impact on the society we live in,&#x201D; Lim said. &#x201C;We hope these symposiums bring together collaborative, high-octane research teams to establish that impact.&#x201D;</p><p>UTA is focusing on research and programs that integrate big data from multiple fields to develop analytics and science that explore a wide variety of data sources in hopes of discovering and sharing new knowledge, as well as enhancing current knowledge.</p><figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/ddd-symposium-dombroski.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>College of Business Dean Harry Dombroski discussed how the college is working to keep its students on the leading edge of data-driven discovery.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption--><p>Harry Dombroski, dean of the College of Business, said the importance and value of data analytics cannot be overstated.</p><p>&#x201C;Companies in every industry are trying to unlock the secrets that data analytics may provide to position them to make better, data-driven business decisions,&#x201D; Dombroski said. &#x201C;This is more than just a fad, and that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s a strategic initiative for the College of Business and UTA.&#x201D;</p><p>Dombroski added that the college is taking the lead on data analytics, something he feels other business schools have yet to position themselves to do. In addition to recruiting a substantial number of new faculty in this area, the College of Business is expanding its outreach to the business community to form strategic partnerships and has offered to be a conduit for any faculty member looking to connect with a company.</p><p>The University is exploring new centers and academic programs across each of its colleges to keep graduates on the leading edge of big data by ensuring they are equipped to harness and effectively utilize powerful data as it permeates all industries.</p><p>&#x201C;This is a great opportunity for us to differentiate ourselves,&#x201D; Dombroski said. &#x201C;We have great faculty in this area and plan to increase that number going forward with the goal of educating our students to be successful leaders in data.&#x201D;</p><p>College of Education Dean Teresa Taber Doughty discussed how big data sets are being used to personalize education for more effective learning. She envisions potential collaborations with the School of Social Work and the Department of Sociology and Anthropology in the College of Liberal Arts to investigate behavior and learning phenomena in U.S. schools.</p><p>Gautam Das, a professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, shared with the group some opportunities and challenges they may encounter in big data research. Kaushik De, a professor in the Department of Physics and the director of the High-Energy Physics Center of Excellence, discussed data-driven discoveries in physics. De said UTA has been at the forefront of the discipline for two decades.</p><p>Following the general updates, faculty and staff members discussed their ongoing projects and areas of interest to help identify potential areas for interdisciplinary collaboration. Karbhari encouraged faculty to take in the wealth of work shared at the symposium and make connections with each other to form collaborations. He also invited them to contact Associate Vice President for Research Kimberly Mayer if they are looking for collaborators but are unsure where to start.</p><p>Karbhari said that data-driven discovery will become a core skillset of UTA students.

We came up with something that worked.&#x201D;</p><p>The impetus for the project actually started with <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/news/releases/2019/03/Garner-inducted-hall-of-fame.php\">Movin&#x2019; Mavs Coach Doug Garner</a>, who wanted something that gave his players both a good workout and measured how much effort they were expending. He enlisted the help of Bob Woods, UTA <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/mae/\">professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering</a>.</p><p>Woods, who has run the student formula racing team for several decades, saw the project as a challenge for his senior design students. Every fall semester, engineering seniors have to participate in a senior design project known as their Capstone Project. In the fall, they design their project; in the spring, they build it.</p><p>Woods said that years ago, a student team had measured the ergonomics of a wheelchair athlete, but that&#x2019;s where the project and data ended. Three years ago, another student team built a treadmill prototype that modern wheelchairs&#x2014;and especially sport wheelchairs&#x2014;will no longer fit on.</p><p>&#x201C;This team has added a pneumatic lift, so it&#x2019;s not as jarring for wheelchair athletes to get into,&#x201D; Woods said.<br> <br> Griffin is elated that something his team did has the potential to help others.</p><p>&#x201C;It shows us how important even senior design projects are,&#x201D; Griffin said. &#x201C;When we can help someone in a practical, real-life way, that&#x2019;s what it&#x2019;s all about.&#x201D;</p><p>Garner said the device also might be used in the therapy sector.&#xA0;</p><p>Other mechanical engineering team members are Antonio Araujo, Matthew McCormick, Matthew Niestroy, Jason Gulledge and Chad Goodlow.</p><p>The wheelchair treadmill isn&#x2019;t finished yet. A team of <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/ee/\">electrical engineering</a> students is building an interface for digital readouts of work performed by the machine&#x2019;s users. Christopher Holland is leading that team. Other team members are Loc Ho and Zachary Kunkel.</p><p>&#xA0;</p>"
