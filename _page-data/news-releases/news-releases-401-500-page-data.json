Penson Endowed Professor of Clinical Health Psychology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is critical to find new ways to reach out to society at large to discuss pain. We really need to explore the use of technology, social media and social-marketing techniques to address misconceptions about pain and the factors that exacerbate its societal impact,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>For many patients, the traditional biomedical model of pain has proved inadequate as it cannot explain differences in pain intensity and disability; the variability in treatment response; the persistence of pain in the absence of detectable physical pathology; or the variability in chronic pain responses for individuals with equivalent physical pathology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our group considers that psychosocial factors such as beliefs, attitudes, prior learning experiences, as well as social, cultural, racial and ethnic group membership, all impact the experience and perceptions of pain, and also affect how care is sought, from whom it is sought, and the entire patient-health care provider relationship,&#x201D; Gatchel explained.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We now need more research to explore the role of these other factors to help formulate more individualized treatment recommendations, and develop a precision medicine focus for pain,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>The report also tackled the topic of opioid medications, which were initially developed for acute pain, but are now often prescribed for chronic pain. The group found that evidence indicates&#xA0;that opioids may have only modest or no effects on improving function for individuals with chronic pain recovery, and that their use may negatively impact functional recovery.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;More research is needed to understand the effects of opioids, including studies that evaluate long-term outcomes related to disability and return-to-work,&#x201D; Gatchel explained.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This research should also compare the effects of opioids to non-opioid active therapies such as exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, yoga, mindfulness-based stress reduction and non-opioid medications,&#x201D; he concluded.</p>\n<p>Gatchel and his working group also published their conclusions this month in the prestigious <i><a href=\"https://www.jpain.org/article/S1526-5900(18)30107-X/abstract\">Journal of Pain</a></i> as <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29578089\">&#x201C;Research Agenda for the Prevention of Pain and Its Impact: Report of the Work Group on the Prevention of Acute and Chronic Pain of the Federal Pain Research Strategy.&#x201D;</a></p>\n<p>Perry Fuchs, UTA&#x2019;s chair of psychology, congratulated Gatchel on his group&#x2019;s work.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is an honor that a UTA faculty member was chosen to lead this federal working group on new research areas to prevent acute and chronic pain,&#x201D; Fuchs said. &#x201C;This work could really provide new hope for so many patients who currently suffer from pain and pain-related issues.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><b>&#xA0;</b></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

If we can work out how human sulfur-oxidizing enzymes function, or more crucially, how their behavior changes in bacteria or in specific diseases, this information could be used for the rational design of drugs targeted for these diseases. Currently, no such technology exists.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Pierce recently received a $429,033 National Institutes of Health grant to continue his work retro-engineering the sulfur oxidation process and mapping out of the chemical mechanism of three key enzymes &#x2013; cysteine dioxygenase, cysteamine dioxygenase, and 3-mercaptopropionic acid dioxygenase &#x2013; to provide the necessary framework to develop effective therapies and drugs for different disease states.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;By comparing the behavior of these enzymes in humans to bacteria we can also open up opportunities to stamp out &#x201C;superbugs&#x201D; by providing an alternate means to disrupt bacterial metabolism without adversely affecting the patient,&#x201D; Pierce said. &#x201C;This is particularly important as we are now seeing widespread drug-resistant bacterial strains.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Pierce&#x2019;s team uses rapid-mix, freeze-quench techniques to &#x2018;trap&#x2019; and monitor the progress of chemical reactions at millisecond intervals. Analysis of these results provides a step-by-step picture of how these enzymes function in both mammals and bacteria. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA chair of chemistry and biochemistry Fred MacDonnell congratulated Pierce on his new grant.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Pierce&#x2019;s group looks at fundamental life processes outside the traditional sphere of biochemistry and employs very modern techniques to investigate enzyme function and regulation,&#x201D; said Fred MacDonnell, UTA chair of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;By providing the fundamental scientific background needed to develop therapies for critical conditions, his lab could make a real impact on the development of new medical solutions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>At UTA, Pierce has also been honored with a President&#x2019;s Award for Excellence in Teaching.&#xA0;</p>\n"

This signaling pathway is called the mitochondrial unfolded protein response.</p>\n<p>In previous research, Pellegrino identified the protein ATFS-1 as the regulator of this mechanism in&#xA0;<i>C. elegans,&#xA0;</i>a primitive worm that is studied as it shares many characteristics with human biology. He then discovered that ATFS-1 and this signaling mechanism also play an important role in promoting a mitochondrial-associated defense strategy against infection.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Mitochondria are an obvious target for pathogens, especially given their role in programmed cell death,&#x201D; Pellegrino said. &#x201C;We plan to look at the way that pathogens interact with the mitochondria&#x2019;s defense and repair system &#x2013; ATFS-1 and the signaling pathway &#x2013; with the long-term goal of developing new treatment options for patients.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Pellegrino joined UTA in 2016 from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York with a grant from The Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas to study mitochondrial stress signaling in the context of cancer biology. His previous discovery that mitochondria are an important activator of innate immunity was published in the leading journal&#xA0;<i>Nature</i>&#xA0;in 2014.</p>\n<p>His group will be housed in UTA&apos;s new Science &amp; Engineering Innovation &amp; Research building or SEIR, a state-of-the-art teaching and research space focused on health-science discoveries that will be inaugurated in late September.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;One of the reasons I came to UTA was because of the SEIR building project, which really catapults UTA into a new level in teaching and research,&#x201D; Pellegrino said. &#x201C;I look forward to collaborating with my colleagues across multiple disciplines in this new environment.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;Clay Clark, UTA chair of biology, congratulated Pellegrino on his new success.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;Dr. Pellegrino is helping us build a very strong biology program with an increasing emphasis on health sciences,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201C;This new grant broadens the scope of his work on mitochondrial stress and immune response and brings a new optic to the issue of how to manage infections.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

That lack of social networking can lead to higher levels of depression, worsened physical health, poor cognitive functioning and higher risks of mortality.</p>\n<p>Lee says volunteering enhances social integration and is associated with higher levels of health and well-being. However, she noted that approximately 35 percent of Americans live with a disability and 12 percent live with cognitive impairment, both of which create difficulty for older adults to travel to volunteer locations according to Lee.</p>\n<p>SageServe aims to connect older adults to volunteer opportunities they can participate in from within their own homes.

We are also expecting to apply for bigger grants.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Since the concept of the app is focused on virtual volunteerism, the need for transportation will be reduced greatly. SageServe&#x2019;s design also will make it easily accessible for older adults who have difficulties with vision, dexterity or memory, Mauldin said.</p>\n<p>She believes the benefits of SageServe will be seen from both ends of computer screen.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Community organizations will benefit from having a diverse pool of volunteers,&#x201D; Mauldin said. &#x201C;SageServe will connect older adults with unique skills and distinctive experiences to volunteer locations that may have otherwise not been considered due to the missing link.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>SageServe brings about an exciting development in the adaptation of technology in the field of social work. Scott Ryan, dean of the School of Social Work, looks forward to seeing the results of this new approach.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;When you combine technology and human services together, there is no estimating how impactful the research can become,&#x201D; Ryan said. &#x201C;As technology continues to evolve how we approach creating community solutions, Kathy Lee and Rebecca Mauldin highlight how social workers are utilizing innovative technology to build sustainable urban communities.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Lee and Mauldin are excited to join the University because of its interdisciplinary research approach to building sustainable urban communities and improving the health and the human condition, two of the tenets of <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">UTA&#x2019;s&#xA0;Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As soon as we show up, we are going to start looking for people to help us design the app, particularly with computer science and engineering,&#x201D; Mauldin said.</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><em>-- Written by Ruben Espiricueta</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

The online students leave us with the same job considerations that traditional classroom students have.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>SocialWorkGuide.org only included schools with online master&#x2019;s programs in social work at schools with not-for-profit status and accreditation from one of the six regional accreditation agencies in the United States recognized by the U.S. Department of Education to be considered. Schools also were screened for accreditation from the Council on Social Work Education. The online master&#x2019;s degrees on the list are equivalent to degrees granted to traditional, on-campus students.</p>\n<p>The rankings are based on academic excellence, student experience and support, and graduate success. Its methodology considers such data points as the average tuition cost per online credit hour, graduation rate, the percentage of tenured faculty and school rankings according to trusted college evaluation sources.</p>\n<p>Rob Voce, founder of SocialWorkGuide.org, said, &#x201C;As more students look to online programs to earn an advanced degree, schools are developing online master&#x2019;s in social work programs equivalent in quality and rigor to traditional on-campus programs. It can be difficult for prospective students to sift the data available to find a program that&#x2019;s a good fit. Our list is unique as it helps identify each program&#x2019;s strengths, while focusing on the elements that are most important to those considering an online MSW program.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>As well as providing data for the ranking factors of included programs, the 2018 Best Online Master&#x2019;s in Social Work Degree Programs ranking includes in-depth information on schools&#x2019; admissions statistics and requirements, tuition comparisons for in-state, out-of-state and online students; and the services and support available to online students.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> ranked the graduate programs of UTA&#x2019;s School of Social Work at No. 34 in the nation for 2019, up four positions from the year before.</p>\n<p>UTA estimated that more than 90 percent of the 115 master&#x2019;s and doctoral students graduating in spring 2018 will have positions in the workforce upon leaving the University.</p>\n<p>Funding for School of Social Work research projects also is steadily increasing, with grants awarded growing from $1.9 million to $3.06 million between 2014 and 2017. Research expenditures, a measure of funds directly spent on projects, also increased from $2.3 million to $3.6 million over the last four years, a 36 percent increase.</p>\n<p>Another indicator of the success of UTA&#x2019;s numerous joint student-faculty collaborations was reflected in the large number of presentations made by the School at the 2018 Society for Social Work and Research Conference in Washington, D.C., in January.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

        "body": "\n<p>Computer memory capacity has expanded greatly, allowing machines to access data and perform tasks very quickly, but accessing the computer&#x2019;s central processing unit, or CPU, for each task slows the machine and negates the gains that a large memory provides.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Song Jiang\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/song-jiang-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Song Jiang, a UTA associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, received an NSF grant to improve computer accessibility.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>To counteract this issue, which is known as a memory wall, computers use a cache, which is a hardware component that stores recently accessed data that has already been accessed so that it can be accessed faster in the future. Song Jiang, an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The University of Texas at Arlington, is using a three-year, $345,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to explore how to make better use of the cache by allowing programmers to directly access it in software.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Efficient use of a software-defined cache allows quick access to data along with large memory. With memory becoming more expansive, we need to involve programmers to make it more efficient. The programmer knows best how to use the cache for a particular application, so they can add efficiency without making the cache a burden,&#x201D; Jiang said.</p>\n<p>When a computer accesses its memory, it must go through the index of all the data stored there, and it must do so each time it goes back to the memory. Each step slows the process. With a software-defined cache, the computer can combine or skip steps to access the data it needs automatically without having to go through the memory from the beginning each time. Jiang has studied these issues for several years and has developed four prototypes which he will test to determine if they can serve large memories without slowing CPU speeds at the same time.</p>\n<p>The current trend in technology is toward using NVM or non-volatile memory. NVM is expected to be of much higher density, larger and less expensive, and will provide many terabytes of memory. Speeds will not change much, but the size will expand greatly, which will also increase the time necessary to go through the index. If Jiang is successful, speeds will keep pace with technology.</p>\n<p>Jiang&#x2019;s grant is an example of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, according to Computer Science and Engineering Department Chair Hong Jiang.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As we ask our computer systems to work with increasingly large data sets, speed becomes an issue. Dr. Jiang&#x2019;s work could provide a breakthrough in how software developers approach software-derived caches and, as a result, make it easier and less time-consuming to analyze big data,&#x201D; Hong Jiang said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n"

        "body": "\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption666\"></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>For four years, three laboratories on two continents have prepared the ICARUS particle detector to capture the interactions of mysterious particles called neutrinos at the U.S. Department of Energy&apos;s Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.</p>\n<p>On Aug. 14, the ICARUS detector moved into its new Fermilab home, a recently completed building that houses the large, 20-meter-long neutrino hunter. Filled with 760 tons of liquid argon to capture neutrino interactions, it is one of the largest particle detector of its kind in the world.</p>\n<p>With this move, ICARUS now sits in the path of Fermilab&apos;s neutrino beam, which brings the detector one step closer to taking data.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s also the final step in an international scientific handoff. From 2010 to 2014, ICARUS operated at the Italian Gran Sasso National Laboratory, run by the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics. Then the detector was sent to the European laboratory CERN. There, it was refurbished for its future life at Fermilab, outside Chicago. In July 2017, ICARUS completed its trans-Atlantic trip to the American laboratory.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The University of Texas at Arlington joined ICARUS in the fall 2015 while the detector was undergoing refurbishment at CERN in Switzerland, and we are participating in its installation and commissioning at Fermilab,&#x201D; UTA physics professor Jaehoon Yu said. &#x201C;We are currently responsible for the data acquisition system and are developing an innovative, intelligent neutrino event triggering system for the ICARUS project.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Eighty researchers from five countries, including two UTA faculty, two UTA postdoctoral fellows, four UTA doctoral students and several UTA undergraduate students, are working on ICARUS. The collaboration will spend the next year instrumenting and commissioning the detector. They plan to begin taking data in 2019.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is now a key player in all the principal international physics collaborations: the Large Hadron Collider&#x2019;s ATLAS experiment, the International Linear Collider in Japan, DUNE and the Short-Baseline Neutrino experiments like ICARUS at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, and the IceCube experiment at the South Pole,&#x201D; Yu said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption400\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/fermilab-1-.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>ICARUS in its new site</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p><b>What are neutrinos? </b></p>\n<p>Neutrinos are subatomic particles that are famously fleeting. They rarely interact with matter: tens of billions of the subatomic particles pass through us every second without a trace. To catch them in the act of interacting, scientists build detectors of considerable size. The more massive the detector, the greater the chance that a neutrino stops inside it, enabling scientists to study the elusive particles.</p>\n<p>ICARUS&apos; 760 tons of liquid argon give neutrinos plenty of opportunity to interact. The interaction of a neutrino with an argon atom produces fast-moving charged particles. The charged particles liberate atomic electrons from the argon atoms as they pass by, and these tracks of electrons are drawn to planes of charged wires inside the detector. Scientists study the tracks to learn about the neutrino that kicked everything off.</p>\n<p><b>Fermilab neutrino program</b></p>\n<p>ICARUS is one part of the Fermilab-hosted Short-Baseline Neutrino program, whose aim is to search for a hypothesized but never-observed type of neutrino, known as a sterile neutrino. Scientists know of three neutrino types. The discovery of a fourth could reveal new physics about the evolution of the universe. It also could open an avenue for modeling dark matter, which constitutes 23 percent of the universe&apos;s mass.</p>\n<p>ICARUS is the second of three Short-Baseline Neutrino detectors to be installed. The first, called MicroBooNE, began operating in 2015 and is currently taking data. The third, called the Short-Baseline Near Detector, is under construction. All use liquid argon.</p>\n<p>UTA has participated in all three Short-Baseline Neutrino experiments. Jonathan Asaadi, UTA assistant professor of physics and an expert in experiments involving liquid argon, has contributed in the construction and commissioning of MicroBooNE and leads numerous analyses of the experiment. He also leads the final design and implementation of the trigger system on the Short-Baseline Near Detector.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s Yu is leading the development of the event triggering system for ICARUS. Many UTA graduate and undergraduate students participate in various aspects of these three experiments, leveraging ample opportunity to work with world-leading physicists in the search of dark matter and of the precision measurements of neutrino properties.</p>\n<p>The construction and operation of the three Short-Baseline Neutrino experiments are valuable not just for fundamental research, but also for the development of the international Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment or DUNE and the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility or LBNF, both hosted by Fermilab.</p>\n<p><b>DUNE Experiment</b></p>\n<p>DUNE will be the largest neutrino oscillation experiment ever built, sending particles 800 miles from Fermilab to Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota. The detector in South Dakota, known as the DUNE far detector, is mammoth: Made of four modules &#x2014; each as tall and wide as a four-story building and almost as long as a football field &#x2014; it will be filled with 70,000 tons of liquid argon, about 100 times more than ICARUS.</p>\n<p>UTA&#x2019;s Yu just completed building scaled-down prototypes for the aluminum electric field cage for the DUNE experiment. The field cage forms are an important part of the Time Projection Chamber, which&#xA0;captures results when high-energy particles collide with argon atoms.&#xA0;Through these collisions, physicists can study the nature of neutrinos and the dark matter coming from beams and from cosmogenic sources.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The knowledge and expertise scientists and engineers gain from running the Short-Baseline Neutrino experiments, including ICARUS, will inform the installation and operation of LBNF/DUNE, which is expected to start up in the mid-2020s.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We consider that the Short-Baseline Neutrino experiments essential components of the overall Fermilab&#x2019;s neutrino program,&#x201D; Yu said. &#x201C;They provide short- and mid-term physics opportunities and are great testing ground in preparation for DUNE, which expects to take data starting in 2026. We see all of these experiments as one coherent effort in understanding the fundamental nature of the universe and are crucial elements for our search of dark matter.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Last year, UTA had research expenditures of $3.5 million carrying out leading roles in the world&#x2019;s most prestigious new particle physics experiments in the United States and around the world. Total grants over the next decade are expected to surpass $35 million.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Radio astronomy &#x2013; the study of celestial objects that give off radio waves &#x2013; allows scientists to study astronomical phenomena that are often invisible or hidden in other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a great opportunity and I&#x2019;m very happy and grateful to receive this fellowship,&#x201D; Rosario-Franco said. &#x201C;I was really surprised and humbled to hear back from the admissions committee so soon, two weeks after applying.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Rosario-Franco&#x2019;s fellowship will begin Sept. 1 and continue through spring 2020 at the NRAO&#x2019;s Very Large Array or VRA radiotelescope in Socorro, N.M., regarded as one of the premier radio observatories in the world. The VLA consists of 27 large radio antennas in a Y-shaped configuration.</p>\n<p>The site also contains the Long Wavelength Array or LWA, which are four-sided dipole antennas. Like the VLA, the LWA combines the views of its individual antennas to provide impressive radio images of the sky. Unlike the VLA antennas, the LWA antennas cannot dip or turn.</p>\n<p>Rosario-Franco&#x2019;s doctoral research of exomoons is both theoretical and observational in nature, she said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My proposed research details studying the orbital stability of exomoons in four-body systems and examining their potential to be directly detected by modern radio telescopes,&#x201D; she explained.</p>\n<p>She plans to conduct the observational aspect of her doctoral research at the VLA. During her time in Socorro, she plans to perform radio searches of exomoons, conduct observations with the VLA and LWA, using data analysis.</p>\n<p>Rosario-Franco, a native of Puerto Rico, received a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in Applied Physics - Electronics from the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao in June 2014. She enrolled in UTA&#x2019;s physics graduate program in August 2014 and in summer 2015 she joined the department&#x2019;s Exoplanet Group. &#xA0;She then began to conduct research under Zdzislaw Musielak, professor of physics, who became her faculty mentor.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I&apos;m very proud of Marialis&apos; many scientific achievements and I do strongly believe that this award she has received at NRAO will greatly help in establishing her career in exoplanet research, which is the fastest-growing field of astronomy,&#x201D; Musielak said. &#x201C;This is truly a wonderful development that gives UTA opportunities to be associated with the most prominent radio astronomy institution in the world.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Rosario-Franco said she decided to pursue physics in high school, when she realized there were no astronomy or astrophysics programs in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Physics brought me closer to my field of interest and unified all the astrophysics topics that sparked my curiosity from an early age,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p>After completing her doctorate, she intends to pursue a postdoctoral position, followed by an academic position.</p>\n<p>&#x201D;My end goal is to return to my native Puerto Rico, where I intend to establish and maintain the first ever astronomy program available to undergraduates at the University of Puerto Rico,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">-&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<i>By Greg Pederson</i></p>\n"

Entrants included students from universities across the United States.</p>\n<p>His poster was titled, &quot;Impacts of small-scale electric field and particle precipitation variabilities on Joule heating: GITM simulation.&quot; Zhu&#x2019;s research focus is Earth&apos;s ionosphere and thermosphere system, particularly related to the estimation of energy input to the system from the magnetosphere.</p>\n<p>This research is supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative project, a $7.3 million national initiative led by UTA to develop a next generation space weather simulator capable of predicting energy distributions during space weather events like solar flares to an accuracy of one degree longitude and one degree latitude &#x2013; about 100 km in each direction.</p>\n<p>Current estimates of the energy entering the upper atmosphere during times of greatest solar output can be off by as much as 100 percent. As a result, the models used to forecast trajectories and track satellites orbiting in a specific region can also yield an error of up to 30 percent, affecting the stability of GPS and communication systems.</p>\n<p>High-frequency radio waves, used in military, governmental and aviation communications, weather stations, maritime sea-to-shore services and distress communications and shortwave international and regional broadcasting, are also affected by the disturbances.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I was very excited and surprised when I found out that I had won the second-place prize because it is highly competitive,&#x201D; Zhu said. &#x201C;The reason why I chose this topic is because people in our research community have been interested in how the small-scale ionospheric electrodynamics process, which has not been well studied before, can impact the energy input estimations in the numerical models used in our community.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Yue Deng, UTA professor of physics, has been Zhu&#x2019;s faculty advisor since he began his doctoral studies at UTA in 2015.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Qingyu is a bright and hard-working student. He is one of the most talented graduate students that I have ever worked with,&#x201D; Deng said. &#x201C;He has been progressing very well in his research, which has involved data analysis and simulation with a global General Circulation Model.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The accuracy of numerical simulation of Earth&#x2019;s upper atmosphere depends on the accuracy of the estimation of energy input or heating, which is always challenging, Deng explained.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We have found the electric field and particle precipitation variabilities are anti-correlated on small-scale, which has important implications for the energy input estimations in the numerical models we use,&#x201D; Zhu said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The current field I am working on is related to the precipitation of the energetic particles from space, which induces the beautiful aurora at Earth&apos;s high latitudes. I really love those fascinating aurora images. And I can learn physics as well as coding at the same time, which are also good experiences for me.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The study&#x2019;s results have been reported in a paper submitted to the&#xA0;<i>Journal of Geophysics Research: Space</i>.</p>\n<p>Zhu grew up in Anhui Province, China. He earned a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in geophysics at the University of Science and Technology of China and came to UTA in 2015.</p>\n<p>The CEDAR program aims to understand changes in the atmosphere over short and long time scales. A primary goal of CEDAR is to explain how energy is transferred between atmospheric regions by combining a comprehensive observational program with theoretical and empirical model efforts.

Last year, UTA was unranked in the category that includes universities ranked between No. 231 and No. 300.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a significant milestone in UTA&#x2019;s national recognition and is reflective of the tremendous upward trajectory of excellence at UTA,&#x201D; said UTA president Vistasp Karbhari.&#xA0; &#x201C;UTA continues to be recognized for our excellence and impact at the international, national, state and regional levels. This progress is the result of the tremendous efforts of our internationally renowned faculty, our dedicated and talented staff, UTA students, alumni, supporters and partners who are ensuring that we are <i>the</i> model 21st Century Urban Research University.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This first-time ranking by <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> is an important step forward for UTA on the national stage,&#x201D; said Teik Lim, UTA provost and vice president for academic affairs. &#x201C;<i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i> is considered by many the gold standard for measuring national reputation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA also ranked No. 5 nationally in the <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x2019;</i>s Best Colleges for 2019 diversity index listing.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA is a magnet not only for high achieving and talented students from across the metroplex and our great state, and also attracts top students globally,&#x201D; said Troy Johnson, UTA&#x2019;s vice president for enrollment management. &#x201C;Having such a large pool of talented students with hugely different perspectives enriches the lives of all and is an important part of our identity.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><i>U.S. News and World Report</i> rankings measure universities in seven broad areas: first-year student retention and graduation of students; peer assessment; faculty resources; admissions selectivity; financial resources; alumni giving; and graduation rate performance, which is the difference between the proportion of students expected to graduate and the proportion who do.</p>\n<p><b>Washington Monthly ranks UTA #1 in metro DFW</b></p>\n<p>A second national ranking, from <i>Washington Monthly</i>, also ranked UTA very highly, at No. 1 in the metroplex, and No. 7 in Texas, in its<b> </b><b>&#x201C;</b>2018 Rankings <b>-</b>National Universities.<b>&#x201D;</b></p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;UTA excels in social mobility, research and service, the three key categories for <i>Washington Monthly,</i>&#x201D; Lim said. &#x201C;Our high ranking confirms our strong reputation in these areas, not only locally but across Texas and the nation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The same ranking placed UTA at no. 44 in the &#x201C;America&#x2019;s Best Bang for the Buck Colleges 2018- South&#x201D; region.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Access and affordability are also part of UTA&#x2019;s DNA.

More than 41,000 students were served in the last seven years. The GO Centers are located on public school campuses and serve as a places to introduce those public school students to what is necessary to pursue a college education.</p>\n<p>The program supports college access and career readiness for high school students, parent outreach and early college experiences. Pathways places college students from all classifications and majors in high schools and provides these students with academic tutoring and mentoring, assistance with the application process, and hands-on opportunities to apply for financial aid and scholarships. The mentors also help school counselors promote a college-going culture in as many as 24 local high schools.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The mentors hired are an invaluable source of information for the students served. Though highly trained on processes and key milestones, the mentors also draw on their own experiences &#x2013; many of them as the first in their families to go to college - as they guide students and families through the college selection, application and admittance process,&#x201D; Amaro-Jim&#xE9;nez said.</p>\n<p>Though the majority of the students served select college as their plan after high school, the mentors also provide support for students who want to look for employment and/or join the Armed Forces.</p>\n<p>More than 250 mentors have worked for the Pathways program since its inception, including 27 in the 2017-18 academic year.</p>\n<p>Dariela Gonzalez is a GO Center mentor for the Pathways Program.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Sometimes I will have students come in and freak out because they know what they want to do after high school but have no idea where to start,&#x201D; Gonzalez said. &#x201C;The program has been really beneficial to students who take advantage of it because it helps them to not be as stressed trying to get all the information needed for post-graduation.</p>\n<p>She said the students using the GO Center come from different backgrounds.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Some, for example, have been told all their life that college is not a possibility, so giving them the information they need to know that college can be a possibility goes to show how the students&#x2019; lives are impacted by the program.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Gabriel Escobedo, a former GO Center mentor and now a doctoral candidate at Indiana University, spent four years in the Pathways Program.</p>\n<p>He has come full circle because as an Arlington Seguin High School student, Escobedo used the GO Center. That exposure peaked his interest in UTA, where he received a 2014 bachelor&#x2019;s degree in anthropology with Honors and Summa Cum Laude.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;During that time I learned more about myself and passed what I knew to the students I served,&#x201D; Escobedo said. &#x201C;I had access to many resources that I could use to continue my own education. I learned to selflessly help others by working with students. From that I learned to be a role model and strive for success in all its forms so that those who will quickly follow would have a path to walk.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Escobedo had a full college experience at UTA but the GO Center was different.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The GO Center was my other home,&#x201D; Escobedo said. &#x201C;It was my metropolis where I felt that everyone who entered through that door was someone who could use a hero to help them. The program gave me the cape I needed to fly and lift them up. Over the years I have helped hundreds of students go to college with scholarships. Many of my former students still contact me for aid and some even invited me to their college graduation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Robert Rummel-Hudson</em></p>\n"

The interventions will continue over a 12-month period with a final assessment at 18 months following birth. Improvement of the infants&#x2019; developmental skills, attachment and the mothers&#x2019; mental health will be the key measurements of success. The Philip and Carolyn Evanson endowment is funding part of the pilot program.</p>\n<p>Initially, Cheryl Anderson, an associate professor emeritus of nursing at The University of Texas at Arlington&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation, and Priscila Ca&#xE7;ola, an associate professor of kinesiology at the college, published current information in this area in an article in the American Journal of Maternal Child Nursing.</p>\n<p>The article noted that mothers who give birth to pre-term babies are vulnerable to mental health issues, such as PTSD, which may affect the attachment between the mother and the baby, and subsequently delay the infant&#x2019;s development. They added that an interactive, hands-on intervention plus education and regular assessments by health care professionals during frequent follow-up home visits may go a long way in helping those mothers overcome PTSD.</p>\n<p>Anderson is an expert on birth trauma in mothers and Ca&#xE7;ola is an expert on infant motor development. The two reviewed journal articles on infant development, PTSD, attachment and maternal mental health issues. They found no instance in which one intervention focused on all of these areas had been tested to aid both mother and infant.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The need for health care professionals to assess and intervene prenatally and at postpartum is critically important because of the potential impact of poor mental health on infant development,&#x201D; Anderson said.&#xA0; &#x201C;Although depression has received much attention from health care scholars as a risk factor for pre-term birth, impaired attachment and delayed infant development, some of the effects of PTSD have only recently gained research attention.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Anderson added that a few hospitals are starting to look for symptoms of depression in new mothers but not for symptoms that could indicate or lead to PTSD because symptoms suggesting PTSD are often missed or misdiagnosed. Numerous published studies have focused on PTSD among adult childbearing women, but only a few studies describe research testing interventions, and these often focus only on either educational or counseling interventions alone to reduce symptoms of birth trauma and PTSD, Anderson said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our intervention is novel because it is directed toward the infant but is anticipated to have latent effects on maternal-infant attachment and thus, the mental health of the mother,&#x201D; Anderson said.</p>\n<p>Ca&#xE7;ola added, &#x201C;We anticipate that the intervention can improve the mothers&#x2019; mental health and improve the infants&#x2019; developmental skills.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Anything that interrupts the emotional bond between parent and infant, such as an extended NICU stay, can have a negative impact on both,&#x201D; said Raquel Armstrong, RN, NICU manager at JPS Health Network. &#x201C;We are eager to find ways to lessen the long-term impact traumatic stress can have on the baby&#x2019;s development and the mother&#x2019;s mental wellbeing.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Paul Fadel, associate dean for research at the College of Nursing and Health Innovation, called the study an excellent example of the kind of scholarly research that finds practical solutions to critical health care issues.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;When children are denied a good start in life due to developmental delays or other factors brought about by their environment, it could have lifelong repercussions for them, for their families and for all of us,&#x201D; he said, noting that improving health and the human condition is one of the four guiding themes of UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Strategic Plan 2020</a>: Bold Solutions | Global Impact.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">--&#xA0;&#xA0;<i>Written by Lekan Oguntoyinbo</i></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\">&#xA0;</div>\n"

He said the program got underway with a $218,000 grant last year.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is unusual for a college campus to have,&#x201D; Cole said. &#x201C;We were able to hire two people in March and in the seven months since then, they&#x2019;ve advocated and provided services for many victims.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Jennifer Sterling, UTA crime victim services coordinator, was one of those people the police department hired. Allison Scott is the advocate for the program.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;re both licensed social workers and are on call 24-7. We can help at 3 a.m. if necessary,&#x201D; Sterling said. &#x201C;Before, when students were victimized, if it occurred after hours, they&#x2019;d have to wait until the next work day to talk. We&#x2019;re available all the time.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Sterling noted that she and Scott provide assistance to faculty and staff members when they become crime victims.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Victim Service units with designated advocates within police departments are typically only found in larger cities,&#x201D; Sterling said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re more immediate. We are there on the scene to assist a crime victim. The police department needs to manage the overall scene of a crime. We&#x2019;re there for the victim only. We can explain the situation and set up a safety plan with them. We&#x2019;ll stay with them if they want accompaniment for medical or legal appointments.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>According to Sterling, there have been about 70 victims served since the service starting in March. She said more than half have been sexual assault cases. Sterling said crime victims also have experienced incidents involving burglary, harassment and assault.</p>\n<p>Cole and Sterling said the program&#x2019;s other aim is community outreach. They said the program talks to student groups, departments here on campus and faculty.</p>\n<p>Rachel Voth Schrag, a UTA assistant professor of social work, is leading the other project, which calls for studying these programs across the state to determine what works and how to evaluate them.</p>\n<p>She said UTA will team up with UT Austin and UT Rio Grande Valley to evaluate programs aimed at helping students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We want to ask what works currently and balance that with what victims need,&#x201D; Voth Schrag said. &#x201C;We also want to be able to measure the outcomes more easily.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>She said the evaluators will have to determine how the context of the universities influence the programming.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Plus, we&#x2019;ll have to take into account differences among the universities,&#x201D; Voth Schrag added. &#x201C;For instance, we might have more students living on campus here at UTA than at UT Rio Grande Valley but less than at UT Austin.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

They will be working with the Senior Companion Program which is part of the Corporation for National and Community Service.&#xA0;See a&#xA0;<a href=\"https://spark.adobe.com/page/ufjGq6UNuHXAh/\">video</a>&#xA0;about the research the professors are doing.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;To date, few studies have utilized lay providers for dementia caregiving interventions and no studies have utilized the Senior Companion Program as a platform for this type of family caregiver intervention,&#x201D; Fields said. &#x201C;Our intervention, the Senior Companion Program Plus (SCP Plus) augments the Senior Companion Program by adding a component specific to dementia family caregivers.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>According to the latest research from the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Association, Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and related dementia will triple during the next 30 years and African-Americans are disproportionately affected by the disease.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Family caregivers are the main providers of support to people with dementia,&#xA0;and they are faced with many challenges in their role compared to non-dementia caregivers,&#x201D; Xu said. &#x201C;Those challenges may include high levels of stress, depression, anxiety and health impairments.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>More caregiver services and programs are needed to sustain families during the challenges of this type of family caregiving, Fields and Xu said. The SCP Plus takes into consideration the needs and strengths of African-American families.</p>\n<p>Overall, the goal of the study is to create a cost-effective and sustainable intervention for family caregivers that Senior Companion Programs can utilize across the nation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our goal is to design, deliver and evaluate a psychoeducational intervention for African-American dementia family caregivers utilizing Senior Companions as lay providers of the SCP Plus program,&#x201D; Fields said.</p>\n<p>Fields and Xu are very optimistic about the impact this award will have on their research. &#x201C;The grant is helping us to expand on our pilot study of the SCP Plus to several sites,&#x201D; Xu said. &#x201C;This award will lead to future studies of family caregiver interventions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The impact of their research doesn&#x2019;t stop there, however. Students at the School of Social Work also will benefit because of the research Fields and Xu are conducting.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are thrilled that the funding will support not only our study, but also will support social work students who will be paid as research assistants, as well as support the infrastructure of the UTA School of Social Work,&#x201D; Xu said.</p>\n<p>According to the two researchers, community partners such as the Senior Source, Inc. in Dallas have been very supportive in helping design and implement innovative and impactful research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These community-based partnerships are integral to the success of translational research and are well-aligned with the mission of the social work profession,&#x201D; Fields said.</p>\n<p>Fields and Xu are excited to see the impact their research will have in building sustainable urban communities and improving the health and the human condition, two of the tenets of&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">UTA&#x2019;s&#xA0;Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Ruben&#xA0;Espiricueta</em></p>\n"

The Federal Aviation Administration awards the grants and selects 10 outstanding masters or doctoral students nationally each year.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Arora plans to develop factor models for fixed-income securities issued by airport-affiliated entities in the United States. Inspired by a factor-based investing method that won <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economics/2013/fama/lecture/\">Eugene Fama a Nobel Peace Prize in Economic Sciences in 2013</a>, Arora will utilize the grant to apply similar explanatory models normally reserved for stocks and public funds to the bond market as it relates to airports over the next year.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">He will then present his findings at the Transportation Research Board&#x2019;s annual meeting in Washington, D.C., in January 2020. The TRB is part of The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The board promotes innovation and progress in transportation through interdisciplinary research.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">According to this <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/08/11/factor-based-investing-spreads-from-stocks-to-bonds\">August 2018 article by <i>The Economist</i></a>, &#x201C;factor investing for bonds is still so new that many investors have not even heard of it,&#x201D; which makes this proprietary analysis exciting for Arora.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&#x201C;Little research has been done on this and it&#x2019;s helpful for investors and government entities because it could be a potential game changer that influences how airports take up financing and better track factors for ideal times to issue bonds,&#x201D; Arora said. &#x201C;Research in business is much needed but rare, especially at the collegiate level, and the discipline offers a scope for conducting quality research that has an impact on society and industry.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Arora&#x2019;s faculty mentor, David Rakowski, associate professor of finance, will be overseeing his research and has worked with him before. Arora completed and published his honors senior thesis under guidance from Rakowski. During his undergraduate degree, Arora also interned with American Airlines as a corporate controller intern, and was awarded the Dwight D. Eisenhower Transportation Fellowship.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&#x201C;He was one of my best students in the Financial Institutions and Markets class and had several ideas that dealt with financial modeling for the Indian and U.S. financial markets,&#x201D; Rakowski said. &#x201C;Bonds had traditionally been traded in private transactions. This new research is possible because bond data is now available and we can apply to bonds what we&#x2019;ve applied to stocks in the past. We can run analysis on municipal markets and increase efficiency.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>With this application of financial modeling, Rakowski and Arora hope to find what makes airport bond funds perform better. The work has the potential for being useful in informing the next wave of rebuilding of airports and potentially even space ports.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is going to give him a great start in his career to have these grants and publications,&#x201D; Rakowski said. &#x201C;For industry, it could be recognized as good applied background in modeling and analysis.&quot;</p>\n<p>Arora is scheduled for graduation in May 2019 with dual master&#x2019;s degrees in Accounting and Business Analytics. He aims for an analytical career path, possibly along the lines of consulting.</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><br> <i>-- written by Jillian Jordan McFarland</i></p>\n"

Formula SAE is a great way for students in all areas of engineering, and even non-engineering majors, to see what it takes to successfully design, build and fund a racing team,&#x201D; said Bob Woods, UTA&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/mae/\">mechanical and aerospace engineering</a>&#xA0;professor, who has been with the UTA&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/engineering/\">College of Engineering</a>&#xA0;since 1974 and running the racing program since 1982. &#x201C;Obviously, it&#x2019;s a lot of fun and it&#x2019;s a chance to build camaraderie among the teams, but the level of competition is very high, even when all that&#x2019;s at stake are bragging rights.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Autocross is a form of racing involving a pattern of sweeping and hairpin turns, slaloms and straightaways. Cars race against the clock. The best time wins.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, Woods said the best team gets bragging rights until next year&#x2019;s meet.</p>\n<p>Racing starts at 9 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 29, on&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/maps/?id=242\">Lot 49</a>&#xA0;on the UTA campus. It&#x2019;s at the southeast corner of Mitchell and Cooper streets. Saturday will be a competition on the traditional endurance course in the morning and a different course in the afternoon. A drivers&#x2019; meeting is at 8 a.m. Volunteers from the Texas Region of Sports Car Club of America will handle timing. Parking for viewing is located just east of the racetrack.</p>\n<p>Several universities are attending this year, including teams from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, New Mexico and others. Some schools will bring more than one car to the event.</p>\n<p>Racing continues at 9 a.m. Sunday, Sept. 30, on Lot 49 for the collegiate teams. Woods stressed that the racing isn&#x2019;t official but all the teams do watch the clock.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The Texas Autocross weekend is a great opportunity for all of the teams to show off the technology they&#x2019;ve developed for the cars, and it&#x2019;s an even better opportunity for anyone who&#x2019;s interested in racing to see these cars up close,&#x201D; Woods said.</p>\n<p>The UTA team has enjoyed success all over the world, with five championships in the United States and one each in England, Australia and Japan. The team returned to Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom in July to participate in the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Formula Student, the British version of FSAE. UTA brought its 1998 car and members of the team that won the first-ever Formula Student race that year, as well as the 2018 team and car.</p>\n<p>UTA Racing also has an extensive alumni base, many of whom come back to visit the program, and many, many sponsors, including the late Arnold Petsche, who donated $1 million to the College of Engineering in 2012 to establish the Arnold E.

When combined with the damage leaks of private information do to consumers, the total cost of security issues is even greater.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Jeff Lei\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/jeff-lei-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Jeff Lei</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Many systems, including blockchains and Internet of Things systems, are created secure at the design level. However, mistakes in their implementation of those systems often make them vulnerable. Jeff Lei, University of Texas at Arlington computer scientist, and his partner, Dimitris Simos of SBA Research Inc., recently were awarded a three-year, $585,000 grant from the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a new approach to security testing of blockchains and Internet of Things systems aiming to avoid these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>A blockchain is a growing list of data, arranged in groups called blocks, which are linked using cryptography. It is a highly distributed system where sensitive data like from financial transactions, could be stored across millions of computers. The Internet of Things refers to devices linked through the Internet that allow people to control appliances and devices in their homes and offices remotely.</p>\n<p>Lei and Simos will use interaction testing, a technique that systematically exercises interactions between factors to trigger security vulnerabilities, to generate test cases and check whether any security properties have been compromised. The researchers said it&#x2019;s similar to hacking, but with a noble purpose.</p>\n<p>Interaction testing has been widely used to perform general testing of software systems, but its application to security testing has largely been unexplored. In general testing, scenarios are applied to systems as they are designed and used as developers anticipated. Security testing requires testers to develop scenarios that were not anticipated and could be used for negative purposes.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Interaction testing for security is challenging because the negatives are often much larger than the positives and it requires creativity to come up with scenarios to break the system. We are trying to develop a fundamental approach that combines interaction testing with other techniques to systematically explore the negatives, then use it to create a more efficient testing system than current methods,&#x201D; Lei said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Blockchains have the potential to change the way we do business, significantly reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Machines can do many things better than humans, but first people must have confidence that the security factors work in the machines.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Lei&#x2019;s research is an example of data-driven discovery, one of the themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact, said Hong Jiang, chair of the Computer Science and Engineering Department.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Lei is well-known for his work in systems testing and the development of new testing methods in the computing world, and this new grant is an excellent opportunity for him to apply his knowledge to one of the fastest-growing areas of information security. What he discovers could go a long way toward truly securing software systems,&#x201D; Jiang said.</p>\n<p align=\"right\">--&#xA0;&#xA0;<i>Written by Jeremy Agor</i></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

The journal is sponsored by Transportation Research Board, one of seven program units of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We found out that Housing and Urban Development housing programs aren&#x2019;t affordable because of transportation costs,&#x201D; said Hamidi, who also is director of CAPPA&#x2019;s Institute of Urban Studies. &#x201C;When people can&#x2019;t access mass transportation or if there isn&#x2019;t any mass transportation in a certain area, the transportation costs are prohibitive for where the public housing is located.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Adrian Parr, dean of the College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs, said Hamidi&#x2019;s work is essential to this region, which is one of the fastest growing parts of the country.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is important that as we set out to identify solutions to the challenges North Texas faces, we articulate the problems that frame our solutions from the vantage point of who is most impacted and how,&#x201D; Parr said. &#x201C;This is one of the primary strengths of Dr. Hamidi&#x2019;s study. Namely, inequity is a product of how policy, planning and design overlap. Mitigating inequity then necessarily involves deliberately working at their points of intersection.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Federal authorities define affordable as a household spending less than 30 percent of its budget on housing.</p>\n<p>Hamidi said that planners believe any household spending more than 15 percent of its budget on transportation is really over a realistic threshold.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;When you roll in the purchase or lease of a vehicle, insurance, upkeep, gasoline, parking fees and everything else, transportation becomes unaffordable for many people in the DFW region,&#x201D; Hamidi said.</p>\n<p>She said millions are being spent on local HUD housing but users of that housing are spending even more money on transportation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The reason for the unaffordability is that many times, public housing users have no alternative than to purchase a car,&#x201D; Hamidi said. &#x201C;There are no other transportation options for them.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>About 69 percent of the public housing projects in DFW are spending more than 15 percent of their income for transportation and thus making it unaffordable. The majority of those public housing users are spending about 17 to 20 percent of their income on transportation.</p>\n<p>The lowest expenditure, according to the study, found to be 2.14 percent for a home property located in downtown Dallas. In contrast, a property supported federal housing program located in a suburban area, 35 miles north from downtown Dallas, is spending 25.76 percent of their budget on transportation, the highest in the area.</p>\n<p>For all cases in the study, location and distance from daily destinations, availability of transit services, accessibility, street connectivity and mixed-use development are found to be influential for properties&#x2019; affordability in terms of transportation costs.</p>\n<p>The findings make it clear that location matters for assisted housing properties to be truly affordable in terms of both housing and transportation costs.</p>\n"

Blockchains are widely used by cryptocurrencies because of their high level of security.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been investing in cryptocurrency for a while, and as I started to research where blockchain and cryptocurrency technology is going. I saw that some Wall Street firms and big banks were beginning to set up teams to invest in blockchain technology and were developing their own blockchain infrastructures,&#x201D; Datta said. &#x201C;The more I looked into it, the more I saw potential for widespread use that would impact my students.

Potential applications of blockchains include creating a transparent, secure election process that makes it easier for the entire U.S. population to participate from their own homes; improving the tax system by creating a cashless society that takes away loopholes and makes it impossible to hide cash-based income; and the secure sharing of medical records among doctors, who could ask for multiple opinions on a diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Blockchains also give users control over their own data, so if an individual wants to sell his information, he can control who he sells it to and keep the profits, rather than being unable to benefit or control where the data is sold if an outside company holds the data.</p>\n<p>Senior design teams funded by Komodo will develop applications for use in the company&#x2019;s blockchain. The students on the teams will work closely with Komodo representatives to respond to areas of need within the company, such as performance enhancement or testing.</p>\n<p>The blockchain competition will be open to local high schools, community colleges, and four-year colleges and universities across North Texas. Students will develop apps in their blockchains to mirror popular apps in mainstream use that will make blockchains more visible and useful to casual users.</p>\n<p>Komodo is making this investment as an investment in itself, explained Steve Lee, the company&#x2019;s chief marketing officer.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Often, when an emerging technology comes to the market, it&#x2019;s extremely difficult to find developers with experience in the field&#x2014; it&#x2019;s all brand-new. That&#x2019;s why Komodo believes it&#x2019;s so important to engage the young developer community by focusing on education,&#x201D; Lee said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Partnering with UTA will give students the opportunity to gain valuable experience while also allowing Komodo to benefit from the innovative mindset and creative problem-solving skills young developers bring.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Datta&#x2019;s work with blockchain technology is an example of <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a>, one of four themes in UTA&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Hong Jiang, chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Computer Science and Engineering is a constantly changing field, with new technologies emerging all the time. We owe it to our students to keep abreast of these emerging technologies and provide the students with opportunities to learn to use them. I am happy that Sajib pursued this opportunity with Komodo, and that it has turned into a mutually beneficial partnership that could establish us a national leader in blockchain education,&#x201D; Jiang said.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></div>\n<div style=\"text-align: right;\"></div>\n"

The AAUW is a nonprofit organization designed to advance gender equity for women and girls through research, education and advocacy.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Shannon Beston\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/beston-fellowship-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Shannon Beston</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>&#x201C;I was thrilled when I found out about the award. This award is arguably the most meaningful acknowledgement I have received for my work to date,&#x201D; Beston said. &#x201C;When choosing recipients, the AAUW considers the applicant&#x2019;s scholarly excellence as well as the quality and significance of their research, but also takes into account the applicant&#x2019;s commitment to women in their profession and mentorship activities.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It was really wonderful to be acknowledged not just for my research, but also for my activities as a mentor to other women.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Matthew Walsh, associate professor of biology and Beston&#x2019;s faculty adviser, said Beston is highly deserving of the fellowship.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This is a tremendous honor for Shannon, but I&#x2019;m not surprised she has been awarded this AAUW fellowship,&#x201D; Walsh said. &#x201C;She is a fantastic researcher and is one of the best graduate students I&#x2019;ve had the privilege of working with. Her dissertation work is helping to advance our knowledge of what role ecological factors can play in evolution.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The AAUW fellowship isn&#x2019;t the first time Beston has garnered national notice for her work. In spring 2017 she received a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant from the National Science Foundation.</p>\n<p>The AAUW award, which is for $20,000, will provide financial support during the final year of her dissertation project, which is titled &#x201C;The evolution of complexity: tests of the ecological drivers of eye size and brain size evolution in nature.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Beston&#x2019;s project focuses on how eyes and brains have evolved in response to predation in populations of killifish, <i>Rivulus hartii</i>, found in streams on the Caribbean island of Trinidad. Much is known about how eye size and brain size vary markedly across species, but little work has addressed how these traits evolve in a single species and what drives the evolution within species variation, she explained.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Trinidadian killifish are found in fish communities on Trinidad that vary in predation intensity, including sites where they are intensely preyed upon by large fish (high predation sites) to sites where they experience no predation (<i>Rivulus</i>-only sites),&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;These populations are separated by barrier waterfalls and present a unique opportunity in which we can test how predation can alter the evolution of various traits.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Beston&#x2019;s previous work has shown that increased predation is associated with a smaller eye size in killifish and a smaller brain size in male, but not female, killifish. Additional experiments have shown that these differences are genetically based, she said. The remainder of her dissertation has focused on looking at why these patterns are present.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We have performed mark-recapture experiments, where we tracked individual <i>Rivulus</i> and were able to measure survival and growth rate and how that correlates with eye size and brain size,&#x201D; Beston said. &#x201C;These experiments have yielded some interesting results. It appears that a larger eye size is associated with increased survival, irrespective of predation. However, we also found that <i>Rivulus</i> that are found without predators show a strong positive relationship between growth and eye size.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;That is, in sites where there are no predators, <i>Rivulus</i> with a larger eye size grow much faster than those with a smaller eye size. We don&#x2019;t see this relationship in <i>Rivulus</i> from high predation sites. These findings suggest that differences in eye size may actually be the result of competition.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The <i>Rivulus</i> found in no-predation sites are found at much greater densities due to the lack of predators, and therefore the competition for food is much more intense. Beston and her colleagues have theorized that larger eye size is advantageous overall, but is especially important in <i>Rivulus</i>-only sites where individuals with a larger eye size may experience fitness-related benefits via foraging.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A larger eye size is correlated with improved vision; thus, those with larger eyes may be better at finding food, which is especially important in <i>Rivulus</i>-only sites, where food is scarce,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;Our results also suggest that selection for a larger eye size may be relaxed in high predation sites because competition for food is weak, an indirect effect of predation.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Beston and her colleagues have submitted a paper on this topic for publication, and she is now writing up the findings of the mark-recapture work on brain size. For this study, they evaluated the fitness correlates of brain size in nature, and also evaluated underlying behavioral differences, such as learning capability and boldness, and how these correlate to brain size.</p>\n<p>Beston will return to Trinidad in November to conduct studies using mesocosms, which are experimental water enclosures, in order to begin to understand some of the patterns found in previous mark-recapture experiments.</p>\n<p>For the 2018&#x2013;19 academic year, the AAUW awarded a total of $3.9 million through six fellowship and grant programs to 250 scholars, research projects and programs promoting education and equity for women and girls.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Greg Pederson</em></p>\n"

Six million was earmarked for eight projects such as Vasilyev&#x2019;s that enable scalable quantum communications systems by&#xA0;demonstrating proof-of-concept technologies that encompass novel devices, circuits, information processing techniques and integration platforms in a quantum communication system, according to the NSF.</p>\n<p>Vasilyev and Huang previously have collaborated on research to develop photonic device technology that could significantly speed up quantum communications.</p>\n<p>For this grant, the team will integrate linear and nonlinear optical devices on a lithium-niobate thin film platform, making it possible to shrink an entire system down to a single chip. This will enable fast, robust and photon-efficient quantum communications over both traditional telecom fibers and free space. Free space, or line-of-sight, systems allow quantum communication via satellite, while fiber systems support communication through buried optical cables.</p>\n<p>Classical communications systems are able to transmit information at hundreds of terabytes per second, but quantum communications are many orders of magnitude slower because they rely on single photons and cannot apply amplifiers to the signal without compromising the secure nature of the transmission. This project will attempt to create an integrated quantum transceiver capable of both sending and receiving the quantum information over many temporal modes represented by various waveforms that overlap in time.</p>\n<p>On the transmitter side, the researchers will encode information on a single photon using lossless shaping of the photon waveform on a picosecond &#x2013; or one trillionth of a second &#x2013; timescale. Lossless property means that the waveform does not lose any energy during the process.</p>\n<p>This transmission system will permit the photon a lot of freedom in the choice of its waveform traveling through the system, and each of these degrees of freedom can be used to carry the information.</p>\n<p>The receiver side will use mode-discriminating photon detection, which can dynamically choose the mode from which the information will be extracted with a very high accuracy.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Creating a quantum transceiver will yield the most important building block for future quantum communications systems that are robust against poor weather conditions, ultra-efficient for encoding and decoding of single photons and optimized for use over both free space and optical fiber,&#x201D; Vasilyev said. &#x201C;If we are successful, it could be an important step in building large-scale quantum communication networks.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Vasilyev&#x2019;s research is an example of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact, said Jonathan Bredow, chair of the Electrical Engineering Department.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Vasilyev has conducted extensive research into efficient, secure quantum communications, and his discoveries will fit well in the scope of this new grant. If successful, this team&#x2019;s work would ensure the United States&#x2019; continued leadership in quantum communication technology,&#x201D; Bredow said.</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><i>-- Written by Jeremy Agor</i></p>\n<p align=\"right\"></p>\n"

This recognizes UTA as a great academic destination for disability studies and as a great place for history.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Sixty to 70 percent of the students in this minor have disabilities,&#x201D; Rose said. &#x201C;Many are caregivers, too. Our graduates are going on to graduate school or working directly out of college. Virtually all plan to work in the field. The minor is part of the amazing disability programs at UTA.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In addition, to the 2018 Taft Labor History Prize for her book, Rose also won the 2018 Disability History Association&#x2019;s Outstanding Book Award and the 2017 Award&#xA0;for&#xA0;Excellence in Research Using the Holdings of the New York State Archives.</p>\n<p>The book, &#x201C;No Right to be Idle: The Invention of Disability, 1840s-1930s,&#x201D; centers on labor, charity, and disability policy during that time frame.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Disabled people have often been labeled as unproductive, that they don&#x2019;t want to work, that they&#x2019;re lazy. Up to 70 percent of working-age people with disabilities are not working, but largely because of persistent barriers and discrimination, not by choice,&#x201D; Rose said. &#x201C;I study why that came to be. Public policies such as workers&#x2019; compensation led employers to refuse to hire people with disabilities. Others ended up working for free inside &#x2018;idiot&#x2019; asylums for the rest of their lives or for cents on the dollar in sheltered workshops.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The Labor and Working Class History Association and ILR School at Cornell University hand out the award annually. Philip Taft was a noted labor historian who focused on U.S. labor history and the American Federation of Labor.</p>\n<p>Elisabeth Cawthon, dean of UTA&#x2019;s College of Liberal Arts, said Rose&#x2019;s work in earning these two awards registers on federal and state levels.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Rose is one reason UTA is becoming a center for disability studies,&#x201D; Cawthon said. &#x201C;Her ability to weave many aspects of university life into the minor only pays dividends for her students. These awards show her ability.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In addition to the two awards, Rose also received a Summerlee Foundation grant to expand and publicize UTA Libraries&#x2019; Texas Disability History Collection. Her team is collecting interviews with Texas disability rights pioneers like Bob Kafka and Stephanie Thomas, as well as Texan leaders in adapted sports and assistive technologies,. These Austin-based grassroots activists have long helped drive the disability rights movement and who played a key role in pushing the Americans with Disabilities Act through Congress.</p>\n"

Like ordinary crystals, photonic lattices have an energy band structure with gaps of different widths. A bound state in the lattice means that light cannot escape the lattice, while a leaky mode allows the light to come through.</p>\n<p>When light shines on a lattice, it resonates with the leaky modes and reflects or transmits in a narrow band. The location of the resonance in the wavelength spectrum has intrinsic properties, and fundamentally there is a resonant leaky mode on one edge of the band, but no radiation on the other. Recently, scientists have realized that the non-leaky edge is related to the bound state, which is one key point that Magnusson is investigating under the project.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We have identified how this band structure comes about and we understand, in part, how the gap between the leaky and non-leaky states works. We can adjust the separation of the two edges and close the gap so the modes superimpose, but we can also make the modes pass by each other and flip their energy positions,&#x201D; Magnusson said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The flip is explained by modeling and understanding the fundamental physics of this class of devices whereby existing science is also understood. We&#x2019;re studying the band dynamics of leaky photonic lattices and performing experiments to verify all of these theories.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Any discoveries Magnusson makes in the course of his research could potentially be used to create new low-power modulators for optical communications systems such as in the current internet or applied later in other devices as technology advances.</p>\n<p>Magnusson&#x2019;s grant is an example of data-driven discovery, one of the themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact, said Jonathan Bredow, chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Magnusson is a leading global authority in leaky-mode resonance technology with a long-term track record in the field. This new grant will allow him to expand his knowledge of the fundamental science involved,&#x201D; Bredow said. &#x201C;His findings have the potential to influence research and discovery in the field for years to come.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><i>-- Written by Jeremy Agor</i></p>\n"

Potential applications for the technology include bioinspired soft robotics, artificial muscles &#x2013; which are soft materials that change their shapes or move in response to external signals as our muscles do &#x2013; and programmable matter. The concept is also applicable to other programmable materials.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We studied how biological organisms use continuously deformable soft tissues such as muscle to make shapes, change shape and move because we were interested in using this type of method to create dynamic 3D structures,&#x201D; Yum said.</p>\n<div></div>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption350\"><img alt=\"Bioinspired 3D structures\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/yum-paper-living-like-objects.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Bioinspired 3-D structures&#xA0;created in Yum&apos;s lab.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>His approach uses temperature-responsive hydrogels with locally programmable degrees and rates of swelling and shrinking. Those properties allow Yum to spatially program how the hydrogels swell or shrink in response to temperature change using a digital light 4D printing method he developed that includes three dimensions plus time.</p>\n<p>Using this method, Yum can print multiple 3D structures simultaneously in a one-step process. He mathematically programs the structures&apos; shrinking and swelling to form 3D shapes, such as saddle shapes, wrinkles and cones, and their direction.</p>\n<p>A video of the process can be seen <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TAOIc_lshxMKW6lkIayOryHYqWhAxcSC\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>He also has developed design rules based on the concept of modularity to create even more complex structures, including bioinspired structures with programmed sequential motions.&#xA0;This makes the shapes dynamic so they can move through space. He also can control the speed at which the structures change shape and thus create complex, sequential motion, such as how a stingray swims in the ocean.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Unlike traditional additive manufacturing, our digital light 4D printing method allows us to print multiple, custom-designed 3D structures simultaneously. Most importantly, our method is very fast, taking less than 60 seconds to print, and thus highly scalable.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Yum&#x2019;s paper, &#x201C;Bioinspired 3D structures with programmable morphologies and motions,&#x201D; was published in the Sept. 12 issue of <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p>\n<p>The research is an example of data-driven discovery, one of the themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact, said Stathis Meletis, chair of the Materials Science and Engineering Department.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Yum&#x2019;s approach to creating programmable 3D structures has the potential to open many new avenues in bioinspired robotics and tissue engineering. The speed with which his approach can be applied, as well as its scalability, makes it a unique tool for future research and applications,&#x201D; Meletis said.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n"

Her interest in biology &#x2013; and science in general &#x2013; began in her childhood, she said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;My favorite classes growing up were always science classes, and I loved to go outside and look for whatever critters I could find,&#x201D; she said.</p>\n<p>After high school she attended Tarrant County College before transferring to UTA in 2012.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;While I didn&#x2019;t know quite what I wanted to do in the long run when I initially came to UTA, I knew I wanted to major in biology,&#x201D; Currie said. &#x201C;I took biological anthropology my first semester here, and realized that I really enjoyed learning about genetics and evolution.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>A year later, she took a genetics course taught by Fujita and, after hearing him talk about his research, realized it was what she wanted to do. After class one day, she asked Fujita if he had any space in his lab for an undergraduate. He did, and Currie was on her way to entering the field of evolutionary genetics.</p>\n<p>Currie graduated in 2015 with a bachelor&#x2019;s in science in Biology. She spent the next year working as an academic advisor in the Department of Biology, and then started as a doctoral student in Fujita&#x2019;s lab in the fall of 2016. In the two years since, she has worked as a graduate teaching assistant in human anatomy and physiology courses in addition to conducting research on her dissertation project.</p>\n<p>Some species of these whiptail lizards are all-female and reproduce by parthenogenesis, a natural form of asexual reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization. They live in desert grasslands. For her research, Currie has visited West Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado to collect lizard samples.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It can be a real challenge to catch them because they&#x2019;re so fast and agile,&#x201D; Currie said.</p>\n<p>The NSF Graduate Research Fellowships Program helps ensure the vitality of the human resource base of science and engineering in the United States and reinforces its diversity. The program recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students in NSF-supported science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines who are pursuing research-based master&#x2019;s and doctoral degrees at accredited United States institutions.</p>\n<p>-&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Contributed by Greg Pederson</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

They are known as &#x2018;jumping genes&#x2019; as they change their position or copy themselves within the genome.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These &#x2018;jumping genes&#x2019; are initially parasitic, moving and replicating within cells in a way similar to viruses, but in some instances they seem to become &#x2018;domesticated&#x2019; to serve new functions within the host cell,&#x201D; said Esther Betran, UTA professor of biology, who recently won a $570,197 National Science Foundation grant for this functional and comparative genomics research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We are testing the hypothesis of whether &#x2018;jumping genes&#x2019; are co-opted by the organism to build new gene regulatory pathways linked to reproduction. Another possibility is that the new pathways are an adaptation to the &#x2018;jumping genes&#x2019; themselves,&#x201D; she added.</p>\n<p>To do this, Betran and her team will be looking at fruit flies or <i>Drosophila</i>, a model organism often used in genetics research, as it has a short reproductive cycle, large number of progeny and the genome can be edited easily. The fly also shares large numbers of genes with humans, including 75 percent of those associated with human disease.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We will harness the power of genetics and genomics to elucidate the biological function of four domesticated transposase genes known as DPLG1-4,&#x201D; Betran said. &#x201C;We will also be using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing techniques to test these hypotheses over several generations of the fruit fly.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The North Texas Genome Center at UTA is a vital resource, as it provides us with high-throughput sequencing of complete genomic and transcriptomic information within a very short period of time.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Clay Clark, UTA&#x2019;s chair of biology, congratulated Betran on this new award, which will also provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate researchers to learn new valuable skills.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As well as contributing to scientific advancement, this functional genomics project will help train rising scientists in cutting edge functional genomics technologies and data analysis, which are rapidly growing fields with many opportunities for professional advancement,&#x201D; Clark said.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

Poor prosthetic fit can cause skin damage and create sores in the residual limb of the wearer.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Pressure ulcers caused by long periods of sitting without relieving pressure at boney regions such as the tailbone, frequently occur in people who spend significant amount of time on wheelchairs. &#xA0;In the case of prosthesis users, poor fitting of the prosthesis leads to pressure injuries for amputees that can severely affect their daily life,&#x201D; said Muthu Wijesundara, co-inventor of the technology and chief research scientist at UTA&#x2019;s Research Institute or UTARI.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our technology improves on existing solutions by including real-time pressure monitoring and automated pressure modulation capabilities to help combat the formation of pressure ulcers or sores.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The researchers recently presented the results of their studies on a full-sized seat cushion prototype at the ASME 2018 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences &amp; Computers and Information in Engineering Conference held August 26-29, 2018 in Quebec City, Canada.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>When a person sits on the cushion, a network of sensors generates a pressure map and identifies vulnerable areas where pressure relief is needed. Automated pressure modulation uses this data to reconfigure the seat cushion surface to offload and redistribute pressure from sensitive areas. Additionally, the seat cushion periodically changes the pressure profile to eliminate pressure buildup over time.</p>\n<p>The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of the technology using healthy volunteers with different weights who assumed different positions: leaning forward, backward, to the left or right. In all cases, the seat cushion measured the pressure immediately and automatically performed an effective pressure redistribution to offload pressure from sensitive areas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;This technology has multitude of applications in biomedical fields,&#x201D; Wijesundara said. &#x201C;We really feel that it shows great promise in helping patients and their caregivers avoid the pain of stress ulcers and sores.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mickey McCabe, director of UTARI, congratulated the UTA team on the recent patent issue.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s Research Institute has the mission of taking inventions out of the lab and making them useful to society,&#x201D; McCabe said. &#x201C;This patented technology will do precisely that, helping patients avoid added trauma and reducing the burden of costs associated with ulcers and sores on the healthcare system.

Many of these chemicals have contaminated soil and groundwater near the areas where the foams are made and used. The Department of Defense is working to determine the extent of the contamination. As scientists complete their work, investigation-derived contaminated soil and water with PFASs is created and needs to be cleaned up.</p>\n<p>Hyeok Choi, an associate professor of civil engineering at The University of Texas at Arlington, will use a $199,985 grant from the U.S. Department of Defense&#x2019;s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program to prove a concept that would allow cleanup of PFAS-contaminated soil and water on site under ambient conditions. Junha Jeon, associate professor of chemistry, is co-principal investigator on the project.</p>\n<p>PFASs are widely used in applications such as non-stick cookware, stain repellants for carpets and furniture, and fire retardants. Cleanup of these chemicals when they reach the environment is difficult because they do not break down easily under normal conditions and are resistant to chemical reaction.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Investigation-derived waste contains PFASs, water, soil and many other things that affect how it can be cleaned. This project is very challenging because the Department of Defense doesn&#x2019;t want the expense of moving the waste, so any cleanup must be done without extreme conditions, such as high temperature and high pressure,&#x201D; Choi said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The technology I use will combine oxidation and reduction. It is difficult to decompose PFASs via oxidation pathways due to the extraordinarily strong carbon-fluorine bonds in PFASs, so I will use reduction technology first to replace fluorine with hydrogen. Then, the defluorinated PFASs are much more vulnerable to chemical oxidation and decomposition.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In addition to chemical decomposition, Choi also will use activated carbon-based nanomaterials which can first absorb PFASs and then decompose them through oxidation and reduction.</p>\n<p>The first step in the project is to see if Choi&#x2019;s methods will work in clean water. If they do, he will add soil and many other co-existing chemicals and components to the water to see if the methods are still effective in practical applications for treating the waste. If this research is successful, Choi hopes to receive further funding to conduct a full-scale project focusing on explaining detailed reaction mechanisms and pathways.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Choi earned a grant in 2017 to prove a concept that would allow scientists to efficiently transform PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate into chemicals that could be broken down easily and with as little expense as possible. That research led to the defluorination technology that he will apply to the research.</p>\n<p>Choi joined UTA in 2009 after two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the EPA. His research has focused on monitoring and removing toxic chemicals in water, including work on the decomposition of halogenated chemicals, and has been funded by the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, U.S. Geological Survey, Water Research Foundation, and Texas Higher Educational Coordinating Board.</p>\n<p>His work is an example of UTA&#x2019;s work to advance <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/impact.php\">Global Environmental Impact</a> under the University&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020: <a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/\">Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Ali Abolmaali, chair of the Civil Engineering Department.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Cleanup of soil and groundwater that are contaminated with PFASs is a difficult, expensive process. Dr. Choi&#x2019;s research in this field gives him a unique perspective that he can apply to the problem and use to create a solution that will benefit the environment while saving taxpayers money. His leadership in this area is a fine example of how our faculty are contributing to a better world,&#x201D; Abolmaali said.</p>\n<p align=\"right\"><i>-- Written by Jeremy Agor</i></p>\n<p align=\"right\"></p>\n"

It replaces those materials with the geopolymers, which are like an ash material.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Puppala said the second part of the project involves using lime treatment on slopes to stop cracks in the soil.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;That will be done at the field sites using 18- to 24-inch thick treated soil design models,&#x201D; Puppala said. &#x201C;This is similar to what we did with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to help stabilize some of the North Texas dams a few years ago. Currently we are designing a slope treatment for the Paris district using advanced geomaterial testing and modeling.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Puppala said the projects are receiving strong collaboration through Texas A&amp;M University and LSU, and are supporting three doctoral students and two postdoctoral researchers.</p>\n<p>LSU&#x2019;s Navid Jafari, an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, is contributing on the slope studies portion of the project.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Anand Puppala&apos;s students\" id=\"story-image-3\" src=\"/news/images/puppala-students.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Anand Puppala&apos;s students and recent graduates</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>Sayantan Chakraborty, a UTA post-doctoral student, and UTA doctoral student Burak Boluk also are assisting with the slope studies portion of the project.

Ming and his co-author, Binlin Cheng of Wuhan University and Hubei Normal University, presented their findings at the conference in October. Other collaborators were Jianming Fu and Guojun Peng of Wuhan University, Ting Chen and Xiaosong Zhang of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and Jean-Yves Marion of L&#x2019;Universit&#xE9; de Lorraine, France.</p>\n<p>Malware, malicious code that is inserted into a computer&#x2019;s operating system through executable software files, is a cyber security risk that can cause issues ranging from minor inconvenience to hijacking of complete corporate computer networks and could lead to millions of dollars in lost time and revenue.</p>\n<p>Hackers use obfuscation, or means of camouflaging, to ensure that their malware won&#x2019;t be detected by anti-virus software. The most common obfuscation is binary packing, where code is placed into a &#x201C;package&#x201D; which is then hidden inside a number of other &#x201C;written-then-executed&#x201D; layers. Once the code starts running on a victim machine, the malware initiates an unpacking process that breaks down the outer layers until the sinister code is unveiled &#x2013; which may not be at the deepest layer &#x2013; and begins to work. Eighty percent of malware samples are packed because it is a very efficient, low-cost approach that is easily purchased on the black market.</p>\n<p>Anti-virus software checks against a database of common code that will show the presence of malware, but the big challenge in malware analysis is getting past packed encryption and compression. When security companies collect malware code from the Internet or a victim machine, it&#x2019;s packed and not the original code, which means it can&#x2019;t be analyzed to stop the malicious code.</p>\n<p>Since malware runtime and executable scan time has a signature, Ming and his team devised a runtime analysis to detect and efficiently identify the point at which the real malicious code is unpacked so the anti-virus software can be deployed against the real code and not code designed to mislead security software.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;There isn&#x2019;t a perfect unpacking approach, but since much of the malware out there contains known packers, if any code is detected, we can wait for the actual malware to be unpacked, then capture the signature for the payload and add it to our database for use against future packers,&#x201D; Ming said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our approach can be added to online virus-scanning services and deliver the original malware payload to antivirus providers so they can create more accurate solutions for the future. It&#x2019;s a simple solution, but the results are impressive.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In addition to being able to detect the actual malware payload in a jumble of code designed to throw off antivirus software, the new process can be run in less than one second, which is one ~ three orders of magnitude faster than current options. Ming and his team are creating a website where people can upload malware code to be unpacked for free.</p>\n<p>This solution to cybersecurity is an example of data-driven discovery, one of four themes of UTA&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2020, said Computer Science and Engineering Department Chair Hong Jiang. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;When dealing with malware, it is very difficult to keep up with people who intend to harm computer systems and software. Dr. Ming&#x2019;s unpacking solution is an exciting development, not only for its efficiency, but for its speed and how quickly new malware can be identified and added to antivirus software. This could prevent huge financial losses and create greater confidence in security protocols worldwide,&#x201D; Jiang said.</p>\n"

Manufacturing processes using ethylene usually require pure, or 99.9 percent, ethylene feed-stock.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Existing technologies to separate ethylene and ethane use enormous amounts of energy and require high levels of capital investment,&#x201D; said Rasika Dias, UTA distinguished university professor of chemistry and biochemistry.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our new technology uses a copper compound that can selectively absorb ethylene in the solid state, leaving ethane out, with the minimum amount of energy release,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>Ethylene absorption by the newly discovered copper complex is easily reversible, so the absorbed ethylene can then be released and recovered using mild temperature or pressure changes, resulting in the regeneration of the starting copper complex, which can be reused multiple times.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;As a result, our new technology is both highly sustainable and very energy-efficient, and could represent a real breakthrough in the separation of olefins like ethylene and propylene from paraffins, which currently accounts for 0.3 percent of global energy use, roughly equivalent to Singapore&#x2019;s annual energy consumption,&#x201D; Dias said.</p>\n<p>The researchers have reported their new technology in the international journal <i>Angewandte Chemie</i>, in the article <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ange.201810460\">&#x201C;Low net heat of adsorption of ethylene achieved by major solid&#x2010;state structural rearrangement of a discrete copper complex.&#x201D;</a> The paper describes how the release of a very low level of heat during the absorption process is the result of the accompanying structural rearrangement of the copper complex upon exposure to ethylene.</p>\n<p>Fred MacDonnell, UTA chair of chemistry and biochemistry, congratulated Dias on the development of this new technology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Dias and his colleagues have taken on the challenge of improving one of the most relevant chemical separations, and one needed for multiple industrial processes and the production of products used throughout our daily lives,&#x201D; MacDonnell said. &#x201C;This could have very important implications for the costs associated with producing these goods, and also radically improve the environmental impact by reducing the heat emitted to the atmosphere.&#x201D; &#xA0;</p>\n"

Waveguides are physical structures used to guide light, usually in integrated optical circuits or optical communication systems.</p>\n<p>Bioresorbable optical systems can be a powerful tool for diagnostics and monitoring in patients who have suffered a traumatic brain injury or who have a brain disorder. When physicians treat these patients, they often need to insert a device to monitor intercranial pressure, temperature and other brain functions. Current devices are rigid and bulky, are made with electronics that can cause interference with other devices and must eventually be surgically removed.</p>\n<p>Rogers and Zhou have designed a device that will rely solely on waveguides and optical cavities, so there are no metal or electronic parts to rust or interfere with signals and the optical elements will be absorbed into the body after a period of time, eliminating the need for further surgeries. That will reduce post-surgical complications, pain and recovery time for the patient. Rogers is working on how to integrate the device in the body so it can be used with monitoring equipment.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been working with Dr. Rogers for years on transfer printed flexible semiconductor nanomembranes. We began exploring how to integrate optical waveguides and nanophotonic cavities for bio-implantable optical probes to make them more comfortable and introduce the ability to have the body absorb the devices completely,&#x201D; Zhou said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;With this grant, we can explore making the device commercially available, as well as identify other areas in which it could be used, such as understanding brain activity and functions through monitoring.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The Partnerships for Innovation Program identifies and supports NSF-sponsored research and technologies that have the potential for accelerated commercialization, including the development of prototypes that have potential market value and the development of multi-disciplinary innovation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;PFI grants helps fund discovery by bridging the gap between fundamental research and a serious commercialization effort,&#x201D; Zhou said. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve done the fundamental research and now we&#x2019;re ready to develop a system that will allow us to bring our device to the marketplace.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Zhou&#x2019;s research is an example of innovative thinking in the areas of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/data.php\">data-driven discovery</a> and <a href=\"https://www.uta.edu/strategicplan/plan/themes/health.php\">health and the human condition</a>, two themes of UTA&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.uta.edu/strategicplan\">Strategic Plan 2020: Bold Solutions | Global Impact</a>, said Jonathan Bredow, chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Zhou has long been interested in applications of photonic sensing, and his collaboration with Dr. Rogers, one of the pre-eminent minds in the field of bioresorbable electronics, has already led to some amazing discoveries,&#x201D; Bredow said. &#x201C;This NSF PFI grant is an important step in commercializing their work to benefit patients who have suffered brain trauma.&#x201D;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

These entrepreneurs achieved 258 SBIR/STTR awards totaling nearly $102 million, as well as 38 further investments. As a result of the team&#x2019;s efforts, more than 20 new jobs were formed and more than 140 jobs were created. Her experience with these programs will be beneficial to working with business and academic entrepreneurs in North Texas.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Mayer is joining UTA at the perfect time - the SEIR building has recently opened as our signature building for interdisciplinary health science research, and we are building up UTA as an innovation hub for the North Texas region,&#x201D; said Duane Dimos, UTA vice president for research. &#x201C;Her experience and talents will go a long way to helping us achieve our goals to significantly grow research and continue building interdisciplinary research teams to attack some of the hardest problems toward enabling the sustainable megacity.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Mayer earned her bachelor&#x2019;s degree in biology, summa cum laude with honors, at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

This complex representation of items such as snow melt/infiltration and the movement of water through soil layers varies significantly with changing elevations, soils, vegetation types and a host of other variables. The process is so complex that the simulation requires a high-powered computer or supercomputer to run in the time frame needed to support decision-makers when flooding threatens.</p>\n<p>&quot;We hope to not only provide better snow products, but also to enhance the ability to predict spring melt and runoff, which in turn will help better predict flooding, distribution of water and utilization of water for irrigation,&quot; Zhang said. &quot;The National Water Model has the potential to merge the hydrologic and snow services, so weather services and climatologists could use just one tool to predict snow pack and runoff/stream pool totals and maximize the benefits of both services.&quot;</p>\n<p>JPSS takes continual measurements of snow depth and snow/water equivalents at the earth&apos;s poles, but it has biases and could mistake something else for snow, creating inaccurate data.

Its primary role is to carry instructions from DNA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Knowing that HOTAIR has a role in the signaling pathway also means that we can use it as a biomarker for bacterial infection,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;Simple blood tests could indicate infection much more quickly, enabling better treatment for patients of rapidly-moving diseases such as septic shock and meningitis, which have been hard to treat up to now.&#x201D;</p>\n<div></div>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/screen-shot-2018-11-09-at-123708-pm.png\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regulates cytokines expression, immune response, and inflammation</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The researchers used the resources of UTA&#x2019;s North Texas Genome Center to demonstrate that noncoding RNA expression - including HOTAIR - &#xA0;is induced in white blood cells treated with lipopolysaccharide, which are molecules found on the outer membrane of bacterial cells. The research showed that HOTAIR gene was expressed alongside cytokines, which are excreted by cells as part of immune response, and inflammatory response genes such as iNOS. As a result, it is possible to conclude that HOTAIR is a key regulator for pathogen-induced cytokine expression, immune response and inflammation.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Long non-coding RNAs like HOTAIR are emerging as key regulators of cell signaling processes and many are expressed in immune cells and play a critical role in immune response,&#x201D; Mandal said. &#x201C;Previous research carried out with Marco Brotto in UTA&#x2019;s College of Nursing and Health Innovation had already established a link between low flow of oxygen to tissues and HOTAIR, which has been linked to cancer.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Having a resource like the North Texas Genome Center really means that we can multiply our work looking at non-coding RNAs in general, a burgeoning field in biochemistry,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>Fred MacDonnell, UTA chair of chemistry and biochemistry, congratulated Mandal on this new research.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Basic science related to the pathways for immune response is critical as there have been very few successes up to now developing treatments for extreme inflammations like sepsis and meningitis, &#x201C; MacDonnell said. &#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s strong focus on the theme of health and the human condition, and the opening of the North Texas Genome Center in our flagship Science &amp; Engineering Innovation and Research building, have enabled UTA to take on projects at the front of their field, such as these investigations into lncRNA.&#x201D;</p>\n<div></div>\n"

She has won several awards, including the Louis Stokes Alliance of Minority Participation, Annual Celebration of Excellence by Students, or ACES competition, a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program and others. Hussein was on the UTA Engineering Student Council and has served in many other student volunteer capacities.</li>\n<li>Cyril Tyson is a pre-law student graduating with a double major in advertising and broadcasting, and double minoring in biochemical engineering and biology. He&#x2019;s looking to become a doctor and an attorney. He is a veteran and a single parent to an 8-year-old daughter.</li>\n<li>V Kyle Tyson is a theater arts graduate, who doesn&#x2019;t let transverse myelitis hold her back. It&#x2019;s a condition where her immune system attacks her spinal column. She has performed on her feet and from a wheelchair. A Shorthorn story says she wants to &#x201C;give voice to those people who don&#x2019;t feel like they can stand up and say, &#x2018;This is who I am, this is what I do.&#x201D; While she is striving towards a career as a performer on stage and screen, she hopes to work as an actives director in retirement communities to hopefully integrate performing arts with physical activity for active retired seniors. She says she lives by &#x201C;sometimes what&#x2019;s meant to break you makes you brave.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>Maddison Adkins is graduating with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in public relations. Adkins was scheduled to graduate in the spring but contracted postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, or POTS. It&#x2019;s a condition that leads to inconsistent blood levels, fatigue, poor vision, vertigo and hypertension. Adkins took a medical leave and came back this semester to finish her academic journey. This semester, she led the UTA&#x2019;s Great American Smokeout campaign, a smash success. The campaign was Smoke This, Not That, and centered on feeding thousands of students barbecue from Colter&#x2019;s. While students were in line, they were handed informational handouts on the dangers of tobacco, vaping, snuff and flavored tobacco.</li>\n<li>Alyssa Myers is graduating with a 4.0 in arts and arts history. In addition to her school work, she has served as an undergrad intern in UT-Arlington Special Collections where she documented the condition of approximately 200 works of art.&#xA0; She has been accepted to graduate school at the Royal College of Art in London, where she will begin in Fall of 2019.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>December 2018 commencement speakers are:</p>\n<p><b>College of Nursing and Health Innovation</b>: Dr. Stephen Mansfield, president/chief executive officer, Methodist Health System</p>\n<p><b>College of Architecture, Planning and Public Affairs/School of Social Work/Division of Student Success</b>: Michael Bennett, AIA, principal and chief executive officer, Bennett Benner Partners</p>\n<p><b>College of Liberal Arts</b>: Jesse Morgan Barnett, assistant curator of education/academic programs</p>\n<p><b>College of Education/College of Science</b>: Cecilia Abbott, first lady of Texas</p>\n<p><b>College of Business</b>: Pete Walsh, chief executive officer, Velocity Intelligence Group</p>\n<p><b>College of Engineering</b>: Jim Greer, physical engineer, executive vice president and chief operating officer, Oncor Electric Delivery Co., LLC, 1984 BS, electrical engineering</p>\n"

Andrews Jr., an entrepreneur and businessman.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Paul Andrews, left, and Bob Woods.\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/bob-woods-portrait.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Bob Woods,&#xA0;the longtime UTA mechanical engineering professor and Formula SAE advisor, has been named the first recipient of his namesake chair.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The Dr. Bob Woods Distinguished Chair in Automotive Engineering Endowed by Paul E. Andrews Jr. promotes research, innovation and development of best practices in the general areas of automotive engineering and design, mechanical engineering, and the FSAE racing team. SAE is the Society of Automotive Engineers.</p>\n<p>Andrews founded TTI Inc. in 1971. The Fort Worth-based company celebrated its 45th anniversary in 2016 as the world&#x2019;s leading authorized distributor of passive, connector, electromechanical and discrete components for industrial, military, aerospace and consumer electronics manufacturers. TTI acquired Texas-based Mouser Electronics in 2000 and Andrews sold majority ownership of the company to Berkshire Hathaway in 2006.</p>\n<p>Andrews has enthusiastically supported the FSAE racing team since he first met Bob Woods through a mutual friend and has been an avid car aficionado for most of his life. His love for cars and automotive engineering is what initially drew him to UTA&#x2019;s racing team, but it was Woods&#x2019; character and leadership that inspired him to give.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Bob has always encouraged innovation and ingenuity,&#x201D; said Andrews upon establishing his gift. &#x201C;And his teams have shown great ability to be on the leading edge of technology and use it to their advantage on the track and upon their entry into industry after graduation. UTA&#x2019;s Formula SAE team is the gold standard of collegiate racing, and Bob Woods has been the heart and soul of the program for more than 30 years. I am happy to recognize him by endowing a chair in his honor.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Woods, who joined UTA&#x2019;s&#xA0;College of Engineering&#xA0;in 1974, founded the student racing program in 1978. The team has since won six championships in Mini Baja, eight championships in the United States and international titles in England, Japan and Australia.</p>\n<p>At one point, the team earned a No. 1 ranking in the United States and climbed as high as No. 5 in the world. UTA Racing travelled to England last summer to compete in the Formula Student competition at the legendary Silverstone track. The 2018 car finished eighth out of 100 teams in the competition, which also featured an exhibition race between last year&#x2019;s winner, Cardiff University, and UTA&#x2019;s 1998 car, which won the first-ever Formula Student competition that year.</p>\n<p>The 2018 car finished fifth in this year&#x2019;s Formula SAE event in Lincoln, Neb., in June.</p>\n<p>Each year, participating students from across the campus design and build a formula racing car from the tires up and then race their vehicles against collegiate teams across the country and internationally.&#xA0;Students have come from varied disciplines across campus.</p>\n<p>Recent cars have featured active aerodynamics and advanced battery technology, including a hybrid car and a fully electric vehicle that was unveiled in 2017.</p>\n<p>A 2017 Piper Professor, Distinguished Teaching Professor, and a 2017 UT System Regents Outstanding Teaching Award recipient, Woods has garnered several honors in his time at UTA. He won the &#x201C;Triple E&#x201D; Award from the Society of Automotive Engineers International in 2013. The award is a singular honor given annually for Excellence in Engineering Education. Woods also received the 2006 Chancellor&#x2019;s Teaching Award. The award is presented annually by The University of Texas System Chancellor&#x2019;s Council to recognize excellence in teaching at each of the system&#x2019;s nine universities.</p>\n<p>Woods also worked to establish the Arnold E. Petsche Center for Automotive Engineering. The Center promotes engineering education, innovation and entrepreneurship, especially through FSAE.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It is fitting that Bob Woods is the first person to hold the Dr. Bob Woods Distinguished Chair, given his history at UTA and what he&#x2019;s done for FSAE not only at UTA, but nationally and internationally as well. He has willingly served as a mentor to other programs nationally, sharing knowledge and advice as they worked to establish their teams,&#x201D; said Peter Crouch, College of Engineering dean.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Our students have benefitted from his leadership for decades, and his encouragement to push limits, be creative and try new things has led to many technological and mechanical innovations. Bob is a fine example of what it is to be a teacher, a mentor and a leader.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Erian Armanios, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department chair, also underscored what Woods has meant to the program.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;UTA&#x2019;s FSAE program, driven by Bob Woods, inspired and challenged generations of students. The program harnessed their boundless energy and helped them develop practical skills through the application of fundamental engineering principles,&#x201D; Armanios said. &#x201C;Paul&#x2019;s investment in education through the Dr. Bob Woods Distinguished Chair extends his record of caring and creates his legacy of trail-blazing innovation that will light the way to an ever-better future for generations of students to come.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Describing his relationship with Andrews, Woods said, &#x201C;Our friend Arnold Petsche introduced me to Paul Andrews. Paul is a highly successful entrepreneur and businessman and has started, bought and developed very large international electronic corporations.&#xA0;He is also a true &#x2018;car guy&#x2019; and amassed a very large collection of very unique and collectable cars.&#xA0;This interest in cars is what we share and I suspect part of his motivation to support the automotive engineering program at UTA.&#xA0;I am pleased and honored to have my name associated with his.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Woods received a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in mechanical engineering from SMU and master&#x2019;s and doctoral degrees from Oklahoma State University. He had three years&#x2019; experience in research with the government before joining the faculty at UTA. Woods has extensive consulting and industrial experience with national and international companies as well.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>-- written by Jeremy Agor</em></p>\n"

They are using a specific isotope of xenon gas for this search.</p>\n<p>If the neutrino is in fact its own antiparticle, then the two antineutrinos could annihilate each other inside the nucleus, resulting in what is termed a neutrinoless double-beta decay. A discovery of this decay mode would strongly support the theory of leptogenesis, which predicts precisely the overall excess of matter in the universe as a whole and posits that the neutrino and antineutrino must be the same particle. Further, leptogenesis shows why we are here.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;If we observe that no neutrinos are emitted during double-beta decay, then the neutrino must be its own antiparticle, which would be a major Nobel-class discovery,&#x201D; said Ben Jones, UTA assistant professor of physics, who co-leads this UTA project with Dr. Nygren. &#x201C;The difficulty is that double-beta decays only occur a few times a year in a ton of xenon gas, so our detector has to be extremely sensitive.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>When a xenon nucleus double-beta decays, it produces an ion of barium. UTA researchers have already demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel biochemistry technique that uses fluorescence or the emission of light to identify a single barium ion. Identifying the birth of a new barium ion will eliminate all the troublesome radioactivity processes that might otherwise mimic the true double-beta decay. The researchers also plan to integrate the detection of single barium ions as they scale up to a detector containing a ton of high-pressure, purified xenon gas in which the electrons from the decay are very accurately measured.</p>\n<p>Nygren and Jones&#x2019; lab has had a very successful year, bringing in more than $1.8 million in new grants. Among the first to congratulate the researchers was Alexander Weiss, UTA chair of physics.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These new grants reflect the outstanding quality and originality of your proposed work and the potential of these projects to make fundamental contributions to advancing mankind&#x2019;s understanding of the origins of the universe as we know it,&#x201D; Weiss said. &#x201C;The projects also reflect UTA&#x2019;s strategic theme of data-driven discovery and will provide opportunities for our physics students to engage in international projects at the highest level.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>UTA is now actively participating in all the important international physics projects&#x2014;upgrades to the Large Hadron Collider&#x2019;s ATLAS experiment, the International Linear Collider in Japan, DUNE with the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, the IceCube experiment in the South Pole and NEXT.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

However, at low loads or resistance, it shows excessive wear and higher friction.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this problem, UTA researchers used pre-milled mixtures of MoS2-based grease and sulfurized additives, which they found significantly improved wear properties over a range of mechanical resistances. Milled metal sulfite particles have rounded or reduced surface energy compared to non-milled particles.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;A single universal grease that is able to function in multiple conditions is key for the aerospace industry, as using two or three greases has proven to be incompatible and even caused crashes in the 1980s,&#x201D; Aswath said. &#x201C;We believe our patented lubricant compositions could fill an important gap in the market and provide a safer, more effective performance.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>This research was carried out at UTA&#x2019;s Tribology, Lubrication and Coating Laboratory, established in 1999 and now recognized as one of the world&#x2019;s top labs in the field. Since its founding, the lab has published close to 60 journal articles published and been awarded more than 10 patents.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Dr. Aswath and his collaborators have established a strong focus area&#xA0;of research in lubricant additives and their lab is widely recognized as a leading center for these activities,&#x201D; said UTA College of Engineering Dean Peter Crouch. &#x201C;The new patented technology&#xA0;can be viewed as an additional route to enhanced aircraft safety through&#xA0;a universal&#xA0;grease that is effective under multiple conditions.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"

        "body": "\n<p>Florida has become a haven for invasive species in the United States, but perhaps the most well-known of the state&#x2019;s alien residents is the Burmese python. These giant snakes, native to Southeast Asia, have become well-established over the past few decades and even flourish in their new environment.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;In Burmese pythons, we observed the rapid establishment and expansion of an invasive population in Florida, which is quite ecologically distinct from Southeast Asia and likely imposes significant ecological selection on the invasive Burmese python population,&#x201D; said Todd Castoe, biology professor at The University of Texas at Arlington and director of the Castoe Lab. &#x201C;This situation had all of the hallmarks of a system where rapid adaptation could occur, so we were excited to test for this possibility using cutting-edge genomic approaches.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-right photocaption300\"><img alt id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/burmesepythons.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Researchers with Burmese pythons in Florida.</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>The researchers originally set out to determine whether pythons could have adapted to an extreme Florida freeze event in 2010. They generated data for dozens of samples before and after the freeze event. By scanning regions of the Burmese python genome, they identified parts of the genome that changed significantly between the two time periods, providing clear evidence of evolution occurring over a very short time scale in this population.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The 2010 Florida freeze event led to a 40 percent to 90 percent documented field mortality in invasive Burmese pythons, so if evolution and adaptation were to be occurring, we knew we should see it over this time period that imposed a very strong bottleneck of selection,&#x201D; Castoe said.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We employed a technique commonly referred to as a genome scan, which identifies regions of the genome that appear to be under strong natural selection, which could contain genes important in adaptation that may have allowed a subset of this population to survive these freeze events,&#x201D; he added.</p>\n<p>The researchers expected to find genes in these regions that are important for potential adaptation to cold, but as they further scrutinized the data, a different signal began to emerge that told a broader story about adaptation in this invasive population.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We kept seeing evidence of adaptation in genes related to cell division, organ growth and tissue development, which admittedly puzzled us at first. However, it eventually occurred to us that there was a connection with a parallel project in the lab that uses Burmese pythons as a model system for understanding regenerative organ growth, where tissues are downregulated when fasting and then regenerated in cyclical patterns corresponding with feeding cycles of most pythons. We began to wonder whether the signal we were seeing in the genome of Florida Burmese pythons was linked to adaptation in how they regenerated organ systems based on their feeding ecology,&#x201D; said Daren Card, a&#xA0; recently graduated doctoral student in the Castoe Lab who worked on this project for his dissertation.</p>\n<p>Armed with a working hypothesis that invasive Burmese pythons may be adapting to more regular feeding opportunities in Florida, the researchers gathered further ecological, functional genomic and morphological data to understand the frequency at which pythons are feeding and whether there are physiological changes consistent with more regular feeding.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;These additional analyses showed that Burmese pythons in Florida are constantly feeding and that tissue morphological and gene expression patterns support a more up-regulated physiological state in fasted pythons &#x2013; Florida pythons appear to have adapted to regulating their digestive physiology to more efficiently eat prey constantly. This is alarming because these snakes have already been shown to have major negative impacts on endemic mammalian and bird populations in South Florida, including Everglades National Park, and our data was suggesting that, through rapid adaptation, they are only getting better at being an effective invasive predator,&#x201D; Card added.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>UTA biology chair Clay Clark congratulated the team on this work, which provides tangible evidence that evolution can occur extremely rapidly in natural populations, and that such rapid evolution can result in major changes in very complex traits that impact the physiology and ecology of vertebrates.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#x201C;These results provide an unprecedented perspective at how quickly a vertebrate population can evolve, while also providing new links between genomic adaptation and complex physiological change related to the ecological impacts of invasive species,&#x201D; Clark said. &#x201D;It is particularly important work given UTA&#x2019;s strategic focus on global environmental impact.&#x201D;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Card recently graduated with a doctorate in Quantitative Biology from UTA, and received a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to work at Harvard University with Scott Edwards, a U.S. National Academy of Sciences member.</p>\n"

        "body": "\n<p>University of Texas at Arlington third-year doctoral student Benjamin Young received an American Heart Association grant to support research that pinpoints underlying mechanisms of impaired blood sugar control in Type 2 diabetes patients.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"figure float-left photocaption400\"><img alt=\"Ben Young\" id=\"story-image-2\" src=\"/news/images/ben-young-kinesiology.jpeg\" width=\"100%\"><figcaption>Ben Young, UTA third-year doctoral student in kineseology</figcaption></figure><!--end .image-caption-->\n<p>More than 30 million U.S. adults are already diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, with projections expected to increase to nearly one-third of the U.S. population by 2050.</p>\n<p>Young said one of the important aspects of his research is that despite recent advancements in medicine nearly 50 percent of diabetic patients still fail to adequately control their blood sugar.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;So that stresses the need for new and alternative approaches to target this area,&#x201D; Young added. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m investigating some non-pharmacological therapeutic approaches that might help Type 2 diabetes patients control blood sugar better by increasing muscle blood flow to their muscles. It could be used by the patients at home as an alternative therapeutic approach for them.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The two-year fellowship, which started Jan. 1, will pay for Young&#x2019;s salary, as well as provide funds for supplies and travel to scientific meetings to present his work.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s absolutely great to receive this grant. These awards are really prestigious and the funding line for them is very low,&#x201D; Young said. &#x201C;To get something like this means that the American Heart Association review panel sees me as a top candidate.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Young, 25, was born and raised in State College, Pa., and graduated with distinction from Pennsylvania State University with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in kinesiology. Young started at UTA in 2016 and is pursuing a doctorate in kinesiology.</p>\n<p>So far, Young has authored 10 publications in scholarly journals, including leading medical journals such as <i>Hypertension</i>,<i> </i>exemplifying his work ethic and the caliber of the rapidly expanding Department of Kinesiology at UTA.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;Ben is a highly motivated young investigator and he has proposed some novel mechanistic hypotheses that should advance research in the control of blood sugar in Type 2 diabetes patients,&#x201D; said Paul Fadel, UTA&#x2019;s associate dean for research in the College of Nursing and Health Innovation. &#x201C;These are important studies because poor blood sugar control puts Type 2 diabetes patients at greater cardiovascular risk.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Young said his motivation and passion for research stems from an undergraduate fellowship he received for biomedical research in the summer of 2015 at Penn State. He spent the next year there working in a laboratory environment under the direction of Penn State professor James Pawelczyk, who flew aboard the NASA STS-90 Space Shuttle mission in 1998 as a payload specialist.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;He was a mentor for me,&#x201D; Young said. &#x201C;During that experience, I really fell in love with the research process.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Young said his father is an electrical engineer and his grandfather had a doctorate in chemistry and contributed greatly to the theory and design of piezoelectric quartz devices.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;While I never really knew it growing up, having these kinds of role models in my life created an appetite for science,&#x201D; Young said.</p>\n<p>Young has great respect for UTA&#x2019;s Department of Kinesiology.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;The program at UTA is great,&#x201D; Young said. &#x201C;It is a very young program, which brings with it a lot of desire from investigators to succeed. It is nice to see everyone at UTA really pushing to complete important research projects. I am not the only one. There are so many really good trainees here, including two other American Heart Association Fellows within the department.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>According to the American Heart Association via <a href=\"http://www.knowdiabetesbyheart.org\">www.knowdiabetesbyheart.org</a>, every 80 seconds in the United States an adult with diabetes is hospitalized for heart disease and every two minutes an adult with diabetes is hospitalized for stroke.</p>\n<p><b>More information from the American Heart Association:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>People living with diabetes are two times more likely to develop and die from cardiovascular disease, such as heart disease, heart failure, heart attack and stroke.</li>\n<li>For adults at age 60, having type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease shortens life expectancy by an average of 12 years.</li>\n<li>In a recent survey conducted online by The Harris Poll, of people age 45 and older with type 2 diabetes only about half recognize their risk or have discussed their risk for heart attacks or strokes with their health care providers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p align=\"right\">--&#xA0;&#xA0;<i>Written by Brandon George</i></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n"
